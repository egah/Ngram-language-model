the,offer,did,not,surprise,him,what,other,reason,could,robert,have,had,for,coming,so,far,[END]
the,hand,of,the,king,was,the,second-most,powerful,man,in,the,seven,kingdoms,[END]
he,spoke,with,the,king,s,voice,commanded,the,king,s,armies,drafted,the,king,s,laws,[END]
at,times,he,even,sat,upon,the,iron,throne,to,dispense,king,s,justice,when,the,king,was,absent,or,sick,or,otherwise,indisposed,[END]
robert,was,offering,him,a,responsibility,as,large,as,the,realm,itself,[END]
it,was,the,last,thing,in,the,world,he,wanted,[END]
your,grace,he,said,[END]
i,am,not,worthy,of,the,honor,[END]

just,don,t,keep,me,waiting,too,long,[END]
i,am,not,the,most,patient,of,men,[END]
for,a,moment,eddard,stark,was,filled,with,a,terrible,sense,of,foreboding,[END]
this,was,his,place,here,in,the,north,[END]
he,looked,at,the,stone,figures,all,around,them,breathed,deep,in,the,chill,silence,of,the,crypt,[END]
he,could,feel,the,eyes,of,the,dead,[END]
they,were,all,listening,he,knew,[END]
and,winter,was,coming,[END]
jon,[END]
there,were,times,not,many,but,a,few,when,jon,snow,was,glad,he,was,a,bastard,[END]
as,he,filled,his,wine,cup,once,more,from,a,passing,flagon,it,struck,him,that,this,might,be,one,of,them,[END]
he,settled,back,in,his,place,on,the,bench,among,the,younger,squires,and,drank,[END]
the,sweet,fruity,taste,of,summerwine,filled,his,mouth,and,brought,a,smile,to,his,lips,[END]
the,great,hall,of,winterfell,was,hazy,with,smoke,and,heavy,with,the,smell,of,roasted,meat,and,fresh-baked,bread,[END]
its,grey,stone,walls,were,draped,with,banners,[END]
white,gold,crimson,the,direwolf,of,stark,baratheon,s,crowned,stag,the,lion,of,lannister,[END]
a,singer,was,playing,the,high,harp,and,reciting,a,ballad,but,down,at,this,end,of,the,hall,his,voice,could,scarcely,be,heard,above,the,roar,of,the,fire,the,clangor,of,pewter,plates,and,cups,and,the,low,mutter,of,a,hundred,drunken,conversations,[END]
it,was,the,fourth,hour,of,the,welcoming,feast,laid,for,the,king,[END]
jon,s,brothers,and,sisters,had,been,seated,with,the,royal,children,beneath,the,raised,platform,where,lord,and,lady,stark,hosted,the,king,and,queen,[END]
in,honor,of,the,occasion,his,lord,father,would,doubtless,permit,each,child,a,glass,of,wine,but,no,more,than,that,[END]
down,here,on,the,benches,there,was,no,one,to,stop,jon,drinking,as,much,as,he,had,a,thirst,for,[END]
and,he,was,finding,that,he,had,a,man,s,thirst,to,the,raucous,delight,of,the,youths,around,him,who,urged,him,on,every,time,he,drained,a,glass,[END]
they,were,fine,company,and,jon,relished,the,stories,they,were,telling,tales,of,battle,and,bedding,and,the,hunt,[END]
he,was,certain,that,his,companions,were,more,entertaining,than,the,king,s,offspring,[END]
he,had,sated,his,curiosity,about,the,visitors,when,they,made,their,entrance,[END]
the,procession,had,passed,not,a,foot,from,the,place,he,had,been,given,on,the,bench,and,jon,had,gotten,a,good,long,look,at,them,all,[END]
his,lord,father,had,come,first,escorting,the,queen,[END]
she,was,as,beautiful,as,men,said,[END]
a,jeweled,tiara,gleamed,amidst,her,long,golden,hair,its,emeralds,a,perfect,match,for,the,green,of,her,eyes,[END]
his,father,helped,her,up,the,steps,to,the,dais,and,led,her,to,her,seat,but,the,queen,never,so,much,as,looked,at,him,[END]
even,at,fourteen,jon,could,see,through,her,smile,[END]
next,had,come,king,robert,himself,with,lady,stark,on,his,arm,[END]
the,king,was,a,great,disappointment,to,jon,[END]
his,father,had,talked,of,him,often,the,peerless,robert,baratheon,demon,of,the,trident,the,fiercest,warrior,of,the,realm,a,giant,among,princes,[END]
jon,saw,only,a,fat,man,red-faced,under,his,beard,sweating,through,his,silks,[END]
he,walked,like,a,man,half,in,his,cups,[END]
after,them,came,the,children,[END]
little,rickon,first,managing,the,long,walk,with,all,the,dignity,a,three-year-old,could,muster,[END]
jon,had,to,urge,him,on,when,he,stopped,to,visit,[END]
close,behind,came,robb,in,grey,wool,trimmed,with,white,the,stark,colors,[END]
he,had,the,princess,myrcella,on,his,arm,[END]
she,was,a,wisp,of,a,girl,not,quite,eight,her,hair,a,cascade,of,golden,curls,under,a,jeweled,net,[END]
jon,noticed,the,shy,looks,she,gave,robb,as,they,passed,between,the,tables,and,the,timid,way,she,smiled,at,him,[END]
he,decided,she,was,insipid,[END]
robb,didn,t,even,have,the,sense,to,realize,how,stupid,she,was,he,was,grinning,like,a,fool,[END]
his,half,sisters,escorted,the,royal,princes,[END]
arya,was,paired,with,plump,young,tommen,whose,white-blond,hair,was,longer,than,hers,[END]
sansa,two,years,older,drew,the,crown,prince,joffrey,baratheon,[END]
he,was,twelve,younger,than,jon,or,robb,but,taller,than,either,to,jon,s,vast,dismay,[END]
prince,joffrey,had,his,sister,s,hair,and,his,mother,s,deep,green,eyes,[END]
a,thick,tangle,of,blond,curls,dripped,down,past,his,golden,choker,and,high,velvet,collar,[END]
sansa,looked,radiant,as,she,walked,beside,him,but,jon,did,not,like,joffrey,s,pouty,lips,or,the,bored,disdainful,way,he,looked,at,winterfell,s,great,hall,[END]
he,was,more,interested,in,the,pair,that,came,behind,him,the,queen,s,brothers,the,lannisters,of,casterly,rock,[END]
the,lion,and,the,imp,there,was,no,mistaking,which,was,which,[END]
ser,jaime,lannister,was,twin,to,queen,cersei,tall,and,golden,with,flashing,green,eyes,and,a,smile,that,cut,like,a,knife,[END]
he,wore,crimson,silk,high,black,boots,a,black,satin,cloak,[END]
on,the,breast,of,his,tunic,the,lion,of,his,house,was,embroidered,in,gold,thread,roaring,its,defiance,[END]
they,called,him,the,lion,of,lannister,to,his,face,and,whispered,kingslayer,behind,his,back,[END]
jon,found,it,hard,to,look,away,from,him,[END]
this,is,what,a,king,should,look,like,he,thought,to,himself,as,the,man,passed,[END]
then,he,saw,the,other,one,waddling,along,half-hidden,by,his,brother,s,side,[END]
tyrion,lannister,the,youngest,of,lord,tywin,s,brood,and,by,far,the,ugliest,[END]
all,that,the,gods,had,given,to,cersei,and,jaime,they,had,denied,tyrion,[END]
he,was,a,dwarf,half,his,brother,s,height,struggling,to,keep,pace,on,stunted,legs,[END]
his,head,was,too,large,for,his,body,with,a,brute,s,squashed-in,face,beneath,a,swollen,shelf,of,brow,[END]
one,green,eye,and,one,black,one,peered,out,from,under,a,lank,fall,of,hair,so,blond,it,seemed,white,[END]
jon,watched,him,with,fascination,[END]
the,last,of,the,high,lords,to,enter,were,his,uncle,benjen,stark,of,the,night,s,watch,and,his,father,s,ward,young,theon,greyjoy,[END]
benjen,gave,jon,a,warm,smile,as,he,went,by,[END]
theon,ignored,him,utterly,but,there,was,nothing,new,in,that,[END]
after,all,had,been,seated,toasts,were,made,thanks,were,given,and,returned,and,then,the,feasting,began,[END]
jon,had,started,drinking,then,and,he,had,not,stopped,[END]
something,rubbed,against,his,leg,beneath,the,table,[END]
jon,saw,red,eyes,staring,up,at,him,[END]
hungry,again,he,asked,[END]
there,was,still,half,a,honeyed,chicken,in,the,center,of,the,table,[END]
jon,reached,out,to,tear,off,a,leg,then,had,a,better,idea,[END]
he,knifed,the,bird,whole,and,let,the,carcass,slide,to,the,floor,between,his,legs,[END]
ghost,ripped,into,it,in,savage,silence,[END]
his,brothers,and,sisters,had,not,been,permitted,to,bring,their,wolves,to,the,banquet,but,there,were,more,curs,than,jon,could,count,at,this,end,of,the,hall,and,no,one,had,said,a,word,about,his,pup,[END]
he,told,himself,he,was,fortunate,in,that,too,[END]
his,eyes,stung,[END]
jon,rubbed,at,them,savagely,cursing,the,smoke,[END]
he,swallowed,another,gulp,of,wine,and,watched,his,direwolf,devour,the,chicken,[END]
dogs,moved,between,the,tables,trailing,after,the,serving,girls,[END]
one,of,them,a,black,mongrel,bitch,with,long,yellow,eyes,caught,a,scent,of,the,chicken,[END]
she,stopped,and,edged,under,the,bench,to,get,a,share,[END]
jon,watched,the,confrontation,[END]
the,bitch,growled,low,in,her,throat,and,moved,closer,[END]
ghost,looked,up,silent,and,fixed,the,dog,with,those,hot,red,eyes,[END]
the,bitch,snapped,an,angry,challenge,[END]
she,was,three,times,the,size,of,the,direwolf,pup,[END]
ghost,did,not,move,[END]
he,stood,over,his,prize,and,opened,his,mouth,baring,his,fangs,[END]
the,bitch,tensed,barked,again,then,thought,better,of,this,fight,[END]
she,turned,and,slunk,away,with,one,last,defiant,snap,to,save,her,pride,[END]
ghost,went,back,to,his,meal,[END]
jon,grinned,and,reached,under,the,table,to,ruffle,the,shaggy,white,fur,[END]
the,direwolf,looked,up,at,him,nipped,gently,at,his,hand,then,went,back,to,eating,[END]
is,this,one,of,the,direwolves,i,ve,heard,so,much,of,a,familiar,voice,asked,close,at,hand,[END]
jon,looked,up,happily,as,his,uncle,ben,put,a,hand,on,his,head,and,ruffled,his,hair,much,as,jon,had,ruffled,the,wolf,s,[END]
yes,he,said,[END]
his,name,is,ghost,[END]
one,of,the,squires,interrupted,the,bawdy,story,he,d,been,telling,to,make,room,at,the,table,for,their,lord,s,brother,[END]
benjen,stark,straddled,the,bench,with,long,legs,and,took,the,wine,cup,out,of,jon,s,hand,[END]
summerwine,he,said,after,a,taste,[END]
nothing,so,sweet,[END]
how,many,cups,have,you,had,jon,[END]
jon,smiled,[END]
ben,stark,laughed,[END]
as,i,feared,[END]
ah,well,[END]
i,believe,i,was,younger,than,you,the,first,time,i,got,truly,and,sincerely,drunk,he,snagged,a,roasted,onion,dripping,brown,with,gravy,from,a,nearby,trencher,and,bit,into,it,[END]
it,crunched,[END]
his,uncle,was,sharp-featured,and,gaunt,as,a,mountain,crag,but,there,was,always,a,hint,of,laughter,in,his,blue-grey,eyes,[END]
he,dressed,in,black,as,befitted,a,man,of,the,night,s,watch,[END]
tonight,it,was,rich,black,velvet,with,high,leather,boots,and,a,wide,belt,with,a,silver,buckle,[END]
a,heavy,silver,chain,was,looped,round,his,neck,[END]
benjen,watched,ghost,with,amusement,as,he,ate,his,onion,[END]
a,very,quiet,wolf,he,observed,[END]
he,s,not,like,the,others,jon,said,[END]
he,never,makes,a,sound,[END]
that,s,why,i,named,him,ghost,[END]
that,and,because,he,s,white,[END]
the,others,are,all,dark,grey,or,black,[END]
there,are,still,direwolves,beyond,the,wall,[END]
we,hear,them,on,our,rangings,benjen,stark,gave,jon,a,long,look,[END]
don,t,you,usually,eat,at,table,with,your,brothers,[END]
most,times,jon,answered,in,a,flat,voice,[END]
but,tonight,lady,stark,thought,it,might,give,insult,to,the,royal,family,to,seat,a,bastard,among,them,[END]
i,see,his,uncle,glanced,over,his,shoulder,at,the,raised,table,at,the,far,end,of,the,hall,[END]
my,brother,does,not,seem,very,festive,tonight,[END]
jon,had,noticed,that,too,[END]
a,bastard,had,to,learn,to,notice,things,to,read,the,truth,that,people,hid,behind,their,eyes,[END]
his,father,was,observing,all,the,courtesies,but,there,was,tightness,in,him,that,jon,had,seldom,seen,before,[END]
he,said,little,looking,out,over,the,hall,with,hooded,eyes,seeing,nothing,[END]
two,seats,away,the,king,had,been,drinking,heavily,all,night,[END]
his,broad,face,was,flushed,behind,his,great,black,beard,[END]
he,made,many,a,toast,laughed,loudly,at,every,jest,and,attacked,each,dish,like,a,starving,man,but,beside,him,the,queen,seemed,as,cold,as,an,ice,sculpture,[END]
the,queen,is,angry,too,jon,told,his,uncle,in,a,low,quiet,voice,[END]
father,took,the,king,down,to,the,crypts,this,afternoon,[END]
the,queen,didn,t,want,him,to,go,[END]
benjen,gave,jon,a,careful,measuring,look,[END]
you,don,t,miss,much,do,you,jon,[END]
we,could,use,a,man,like,you,on,the,wall,[END]
jon,swelled,with,pride,[END]
robb,is,a,stronger,lance,than,i,am,but,i,m,the,better,sword,and,hullen,says,i,sit,a,horse,as,well,as,anyone,in,the,castle,[END]
notable,achievements,[END]
take,me,with,you,when,you,go,back,to,the,wall,jon,said,in,a,sudden,rush,[END]
father,will,give,me,leave,to,go,if,you,ask,him,i,know,he,will,[END]
uncle,benjen,studied,his,face,carefully,[END]
the,wall,is,a,hard,place,for,a,boy,jon,[END]
i,am,almost,a,man,grown,jon,protested,[END]
i,will,turn,fifteen,on,my,next,name,day,and,maester,luwin,says,bastards,grow,up,faster,than,other,children,[END]
that,s,true,enough,benjen,said,with,a,downward,twist,of,his,mouth,[END]
he,took,jon,s,cup,from,the,table,filled,it,fresh,from,a,nearby,pitcher,and,drank,down,a,long,swallow,[END]
daeren,targaryen,was,only,fourteen,when,he,conquered,dorne,jon,said,[END]
the,young,dragon,was,one,of,his,heroes,[END]
a,conquest,that,lasted,a,summer,his,uncle,pointed,out,[END]
your,boy,king,lost,ten,thousand,men,taking,the,place,and,another,fifty,trying,to,hold,it,[END]
someone,should,have,told,him,that,war,isn,t,a,game,he,took,another,sip,of,wine,[END]
also,he,said,wiping,his,mouth,daeren,targaryen,was,only,eighteen,when,he,died,[END]
or,have,you,forgotten,that,part,[END]
i,forget,nothing,jon,boasted,[END]
the,wine,was,making,him,bold,[END]
he,tried,to,sit,very,straight,to,make,himself,seem,taller,[END]
i,want,to,serve,in,the,night,s,watch,uncle,[END]
he,had,thought,on,it,long,and,hard,lying,abed,at,night,while,his,brothers,slept,around,him,[END]
robb,would,someday,inherit,winterfell,would,command,great,armies,as,the,warden,of,the,north,[END]
bran,and,rickon,would,be,robb,s,bannermen,and,rule,holdfasts,in,his,name,[END]
his,sisters,arya,and,sansa,would,marry,the,heirs,of,other,great,houses,and,go,south,as,mistress,of,castles,of,their,own,[END]
but,what,place,could,a,bastard,hope,to,earn,[END]
you,don,t,know,what,you,re,asking,jon,[END]
the,night,s,watch,is,a,sworn,brotherhood,[END]
we,have,no,families,[END]
none,of,us,will,ever,father,sons,[END]
our,wife,is,duty,[END]
our,mistress,is,honor,[END]
a,bastard,can,have,honor,too,jon,said,[END]
i,am,ready,to,swear,your,oath,[END]
you,are,a,boy,of,fourteen,benjen,said,[END]
not,a,man,not,yet,[END]
until,you,have,known,a,woman,you,cannot,understand,what,you,would,be,giving,up,[END]
i,don,t,care,about,that,jon,said,hotly,[END]
you,might,if,you,knew,what,it,meant,benjen,said,[END]
if,you,knew,what,the,oath,would,cost,you,you,might,be,less,eager,to,pay,the,price,son,[END]
jon,felt,anger,rise,inside,him,[END]
i,m,not,your,son,[END]
benjen,stark,stood,up,[END]
more,s,the,pity,he,put,a,hand,on,jon,s,shoulder,[END]
come,back,to,me,after,you,ve,fathered,a,few,bastards,of,your,own,and,we,ll,see,how,you,feel,[END]
jon,trembled,[END]
i,will,never,father,a,bastard,he,said,carefully,[END]
never,he,spat,it,out,like,venom,[END]
suddenly,he,realized,that,the,table,had,fallen,silent,and,they,were,all,looking,at,him,[END]
he,felt,the,tears,begin,to,well,behind,his,eyes,[END]
he,pushed,himself,to,his,feet,[END]
i,must,be,excused,he,said,with,the,last,of,his,dignity,[END]
he,whirled,and,bolted,before,they,could,see,him,cry,[END]
he,must,have,drunk,more,wine,than,he,had,realized,[END]
his,feet,got,tangled,under,him,as,he,tried,to,leave,and,he,lurched,sideways,into,a,serving,girl,and,sent,a,flagon,of,spiced,wine,crashing,to,the,floor,[END]
laughter,boomed,all,around,him,and,jon,felt,hot,tears,on,his,cheeks,[END]
someone,tried,to,steady,him,[END]
he,wrenched,free,of,their,grip,and,ran,half-blind,for,the,door,[END]
ghost,followed,close,at,his,heels,out,into,the,night,[END]
the,yard,was,quiet,and,empty,[END]
a,lone,sentry,stood,high,on,the,battlements,of,the,inner,wall,his,cloak,pulled,tight,around,him,against,the,cold,[END]
he,looked,bored,and,miserable,as,he,huddled,there,alone,but,jon,would,have,traded,places,with,him,in,an,instant,[END]
otherwise,the,castle,was,dark,and,deserted,[END]
jon,had,seen,an,abandoned,holdfast,once,a,drear,place,where,nothing,moved,but,the,wind,and,the,stones,kept,silent,about,whatever,people,had,lived,there,[END]
winterfell,reminded,him,of,that,tonight,[END]
the,sounds,of,music,and,song,spilled,through,the,open,windows,behind,him,[END]
they,were,the,last,things,jon,wanted,to,hear,[END]
he,wiped,away,his,tears,on,the,sleeve,of,his,shirt,furious,that,he,had,let,them,fall,and,turned,to,go,[END]
boy,a,voice,called,out,to,him,[END]
jon,turned,[END]
tyrion,lannister,was,sitting,on,the,ledge,above,the,door,to,the,great,hall,looking,for,all,the,world,like,a,gargoyle,[END]
the,dwarf,grinned,down,at,him,[END]

ned,crossed,to,the,wardrobe,and,slipped,on,a,heavy,robe,[END]
catelyn,realized,suddenly,how,cold,it,had,become,[END]
she,sat,up,in,bed,and,pulled,the,furs,to,her,chin,[END]
perhaps,we,should,close,the,windows,she,suggested,[END]
ned,nodded,absently,[END]
maester,luwin,was,shown,in,[END]
the,maester,was,a,small,grey,man,[END]
his,eyes,were,grey,and,quick,and,saw,much,[END]
his,hair,was,grey,what,little,the,years,had,left,him,[END]
his,robe,was,grey,wool,trimmed,with,white,fur,the,stark,colors,[END]
its,great,floppy,sleeves,had,pockets,hidden,inside,[END]
luwin,was,always,tucking,things,into,those,sleeves,and,producing,other,things,from,them,books,messages,strange,artifacts,toys,for,the,children,[END]
with,all,he,kept,hidden,in,his,sleeves,catelyn,was,surprised,that,maester,luwin,could,lift,his,arms,at,all,[END]
the,maester,waited,until,the,door,had,closed,behind,him,before,he,spoke,[END]
my,lord,he,said,to,ned,pardon,for,disturbing,your,rest,[END]

my,servants,saw,no,one,but,it,must,have,been,brought,by,someone,in,the,king,s,party,[END]
we,have,had,no,other,visitors,from,the,south,[END]
a,wooden,box,you,say,catelyn,said,[END]

the,lenscrafters,of,myr,are,without,equal,[END]

he,had,little,patience,for,this,sort,of,thing,catelyn,knew,[END]
a,lens,he,said,[END]
what,has,that,to,do,with,me,[END]
i,asked,the,same,question,maester,luwin,said,[END]
clearly,there,was,more,to,this,than,the,seeming,[END]
under,the,heavy,weight,of,her,furs,catelyn,shivered,[END]
a,lens,is,an,instrument,to,help,us,see,[END]
indeed,it,is,he,fingered,the,collar,of,his,order,a,heavy,chain,worn,tight,around,the,neck,beneath,his,robe,each,link,forged,from,a,different,metal,[END]
catelyn,could,feel,dread,stirring,inside,her,once,again,[END]
what,is,it,that,they,would,have,us,see,more,clearly,[END]
the,very,thing,i,asked,myself,maester,luwin,drew,a,tightly,rolled,paper,out,of,his,sleeve,[END]
i,found,the,true,message,concealed,within,a,false,bottom,when,i,dismantled,the,box,the,lens,had,come,in,but,it,is,not,for,my,eyes,[END]

catelyn,nodded,not,trusting,to,speak,[END]
the,maester,placed,the,paper,on,the,table,beside,the,bed,[END]
it,was,sealed,with,a,small,blob,of,blue,wax,[END]
luwin,bowed,and,began,to,retreat,[END]

catelyn,broke,the,seal,[END]
her,eyes,moved,over,the,words,[END]
at,first,they,made,no,sense,to,her,[END]
then,she,remembered,[END]
lysa,took,no,chances,[END]

her,thoughts,were,more,of,robb,the,infant,at,her,breast,than,of,the,husband,she,scarcely,knew,[END]
he,was,welcome,to,whatever,solace,he,might,find,between,battles,[END]
and,if,his,seed,quickened,she,expected,he,would,see,to,the,child,s,needs,[END]
he,did,more,than,that,[END]
the,starks,were,not,like,other,men,[END]
ned,brought,his,bastard,home,with,him,and,called,him,son,for,all,the,north,to,see,[END]
when,the,wars,were,over,at,last,and,catelyn,rode,to,winterfell,jon,and,his,wet,nurse,had,already,taken,up,residence,[END]
that,cut,deep,[END]
ned,would,not,speak,of,the,mother,not,so,much,as,a,word,but,a,castle,has,no,secrets,and,catelyn,heard,her,maids,repeating,tales,they,heard,from,the,lips,of,her,husband,s,soldiers,[END]
they,whispered,of,ser,arthur,dayne,the,sword,of,the,morning,deadliest,of,the,seven,knights,of,aerys,s,kingsguard,and,of,how,their,young,lord,had,slain,him,in,single,combat,[END]
and,they,told,how,afterward,ned,had,carried,ser,arthur,s,sword,back,to,the,beautiful,young,sister,who,awaited,him,in,a,castle,called,starfall,on,the,shores,of,the,summer,sea,[END]
the,lady,ashara,dayne,tall,and,fair,with,haunting,violet,eyes,[END]
it,had,taken,her,a,fortnight,to,marshal,her,courage,but,finally,in,bed,one,night,catelyn,had,asked,her,husband,the,truth,of,it,asked,him,to,his,face,[END]
that,was,the,only,time,in,all,their,years,that,ned,had,ever,frightened,her,[END]
never,ask,me,about,jon,he,said,cold,as,ice,[END]
he,is,my,blood,and,that,is,all,you,need,to,know,[END]
and,now,i,will,learn,where,you,heard,that,name,my,lady,she,had,pledged,to,obey,she,told,him,and,from,that,day,on,the,whispering,had,stopped,and,ashara,dayne,s,name,was,never,heard,in,winterfell,again,[END]
whoever,jon,s,mother,had,been,ned,must,have,loved,her,fiercely,for,nothing,catelyn,said,would,persuade,him,to,send,the,boy,away,[END]
it,was,the,one,thing,she,could,never,forgive,him,[END]
she,had,come,to,love,her,husband,with,all,her,heart,but,she,had,never,found,it,in,her,to,love,jon,[END]
she,might,have,overlooked,a,dozen,bastards,for,ned,s,sake,so,long,as,they,were,out,of,sight,[END]
jon,was,never,out,of,sight,and,as,he,grew,he,looked,more,like,ned,than,any,of,the,trueborn,sons,she,bore,him,[END]
somehow,that,made,it,worse,[END]
jon,must,go,she,said,now,[END]
he,and,robb,are,close,ned,said,[END]
i,had,hoped,[END]
he,cannot,stay,here,catelyn,said,cutting,him,off,[END]
he,is,your,son,not,mine,[END]
i,will,not,have,him,it,was,hard,she,knew,but,no,less,the,truth,[END]
ned,would,do,the,boy,no,kindness,by,leaving,him,here,at,winterfell,[END]
the,look,ned,gave,her,was,anguished,[END]
you,know,i,cannot,take,him,south,[END]
there,will,be,no,place,for,him,at,court,[END]
a,boy,with,a,bastard,s,name,you,know,what,they,will,say,of,him,[END]
he,will,be,shunned,[END]
catelyn,armored,her,heart,against,the,mute,appeal,in,her,husband,s,eyes,[END]
they,say,your,friend,robert,has,fathered,a,dozen,bastards,himself,[END]
and,none,of,them,has,ever,been,seen,at,court,ned,blazed,[END]
the,lannister,woman,has,seen,to,that,[END]
how,can,you,be,so,damnably,cruel,catelyn,[END]
he,is,only,a,boy,[END]
he,[END]
his,fury,was,on,him,[END]
he,might,have,said,more,and,worse,but,maester,luwin,cut,in,[END]
another,solution,presents,itself,he,said,his,voice,quiet,[END]
your,brother,benjen,came,to,me,about,jon,a,few,days,ago,[END]
it,seems,the,boy,aspires,to,take,the,black,[END]
ned,looked,shocked,[END]
he,asked,to,join,the,night,s,watch,[END]
catelyn,said,nothing,[END]
let,ned,work,it,out,in,his,own,mind,her,voice,would,not,be,welcome,now,[END]
yet,gladly,would,she,have,kissed,the,maester,just,then,[END]
his,was,the,perfect,solution,[END]
benjen,stark,was,a,sworn,brother,[END]
jon,would,be,a,son,to,him,the,child,he,would,never,have,[END]
and,in,time,the,boy,would,take,the,oath,as,well,[END]
he,would,father,no,sons,who,might,someday,contest,with,catelyn,s,own,grandchildren,for,winterfell,[END]
maester,luwin,said,there,is,great,honor,in,service,on,the,wall,my,lord,[END]
and,even,a,bastard,may,rise,high,in,the,night,s,watch,ned,reflected,[END]
still,his,voice,was,troubled,[END]
jon,is,so,young,[END]
if,he,asked,this,when,he,was,a,man,grown,that,would,be,one,thing,but,a,boy,of,fourteen,[END]
a,hard,sacrifice,maester,luwin,agreed,[END]
yet,these,are,hard,times,my,lord,[END]
his,road,is,no,crueler,than,yours,or,your,lady,s,[END]
catelyn,thought,of,the,three,children,she,must,lose,[END]
it,was,not,easy,keeping,silent,then,[END]
ned,turned,away,from,them,to,gaze,out,the,window,his,long,face,silent,and,thoughtful,[END]
finally,he,sighed,and,turned,back,[END]
very,well,he,said,to,maester,luwin,[END]
i,suppose,it,is,for,the,best,[END]
i,will,speak,to,ben,[END]
when,shall,we,tell,jon,the,maester,asked,[END]
when,i,must,[END]
preparations,must,be,made,[END]
it,will,be,a,fortnight,before,we,are,ready,to,depart,[END]
i,would,sooner,let,jon,enjoy,these,last,few,days,[END]
summer,will,end,soon,enough,and,childhood,as,well,[END]
when,the,time,comes,i,will,tell,him,myself,[END]
arya,[END]
arya,s,stitches,were,crooked,again,[END]
she,frowned,down,at,them,with,dismay,and,glanced,over,to,where,her,sister,sansa,sat,among,the,other,girls,[END]
sansa,s,needlework,was,exquisite,[END]
everyone,said,so,[END]
sansa,s,work,is,as,pretty,as,she,is,septa,mordane,told,their,lady,mother,once,[END]
she,has,such,fine,delicate,hands,when,lady,catelyn,had,asked,about,arya,the,septa,had,sniffed,[END]
arya,has,the,hands,of,a,blacksmith,[END]
arya,glanced,furtively,across,the,room,worried,that,septa,mordane,might,have,read,her,thoughts,but,the,septa,was,paying,her,no,attention,today,[END]
she,was,sitting,with,the,princess,myrcella,all,smiles,and,admiration,[END]
it,was,not,often,that,the,septa,was,privileged,to,instruct,a,royal,princess,in,the,womanly,arts,as,she,had,said,when,the,queen,brought,myrcella,to,join,them,[END]
arya,thought,that,myrcella,s,stitches,looked,a,little,crooked,too,but,you,would,never,know,it,from,the,way,septa,mordane,was,cooing,[END]
she,studied,her,own,work,again,looking,for,some,way,to,salvage,it,then,sighed,and,put,down,the,needle,[END]
she,looked,glumly,at,her,sister,[END]
sansa,was,chatting,away,happily,as,she,worked,[END]
beth,cassel,ser,rodrik,s,little,girl,was,sitting,by,her,feet,listening,to,every,word,she,said,and,jeyne,poole,was,leaning,over,to,whisper,something,in,her,ear,[END]

beth,blushed,[END]
no,one,answered,[END]
tell,me,arya,said,[END]
jeyne,glanced,over,to,make,certain,that,septa,mordane,was,not,listening,[END]
myrcella,said,something,then,and,the,septa,laughed,along,with,the,rest,of,the,ladies,[END]
we,were,talking,about,the,prince,sansa,said,her,voice,soft,as,a,kiss,[END]
arya,knew,which,prince,she,meant,joffrey,of,course,[END]
the,tall,handsome,one,[END]
sansa,got,to,sit,with,him,at,the,feast,[END]
arya,had,to,sit,with,the,little,fat,one,[END]
naturally,[END]
joffrey,likes,your,sister,jeyne,whispered,proud,as,if,she,had,something,to,do,with,it,[END]
she,was,the,daughter,of,winterfell,s,steward,and,sansa,s,dearest,friend,[END]
he,told,her,she,was,very,beautiful,[END]
he,s,going,to,marry,her,little,beth,said,dreamily,hugging,herself,[END]
then,sansa,will,be,queen,of,all,the,realm,[END]
sansa,had,the,grace,to,blush,[END]
she,blushed,prettily,[END]
she,did,everything,prettily,arya,thought,with,dull,resentment,[END]
beth,you,shouldn,t,make,up,stories,sansa,corrected,the,younger,girl,gently,stroking,her,hair,to,take,the,harshness,out,of,her,words,[END]
she,looked,at,arya,[END]
what,did,you,think,of,prince,joff,sister,[END]
he,s,very,gallant,don,t,you,think,[END]
jon,says,he,looks,like,a,girl,arya,said,[END]
sansa,sighed,as,she,stitched,[END]
poor,jon,she,said,[END]
he,gets,jealous,because,he,s,a,bastard,[END]
he,s,our,brother,arya,said,much,too,loudly,[END]
her,voice,cut,through,the,afternoon,quiet,of,the,tower,room,[END]
septa,mordane,raised,her,eyes,[END]
she,had,a,bony,face,sharp,eyes,and,a,thin,lipless,mouth,made,for,frowning,[END]
it,was,frowning,now,[END]
what,are,you,talking,about,children,[END]
our,half,brother,sansa,corrected,soft,and,precise,[END]
she,smiled,for,the,septa,[END]
arya,and,i,were,remarking,on,how,pleased,we,were,to,have,the,princess,with,us,today,she,said,[END]
septa,mordane,nodded,[END]
indeed,[END]
a,great,honor,for,us,all,princess,myrcella,smiled,uncertainly,at,the,compliment,[END]
arya,why,aren,t,you,at,work,the,septa,asked,[END]
she,rose,to,her,feet,starched,skirts,rustling,as,she,started,across,the,room,[END]
let,me,see,your,stitches,[END]
arya,wanted,to,scream,[END]
it,was,just,like,sansa,to,go,and,attract,the,septa,s,attention,[END]
here,she,said,surrendering,up,her,work,[END]
the,septa,examined,the,fabric,[END]
arya,arya,arya,she,said,[END]
this,will,not,do,[END]
this,will,not,do,at,all,[END]
everyone,was,looking,at,her,[END]
it,was,too,much,[END]
sansa,was,too,well,bred,to,smile,at,her,sister,s,disgrace,but,jeyne,was,smirking,on,her,behalf,[END]
even,princess,myrcella,looked,sorry,for,her,[END]
arya,felt,tears,filling,her,eyes,[END]
she,pushed,herself,out,of,her,chair,and,bolted,for,the,door,[END]
septa,mordane,called,after,her,[END]
arya,come,back,here,[END]
don,t,you,take,another,step,[END]
your,lady,mother,will,hear,of,this,[END]
in,front,of,our,royal,princess,too,[END]
you,ll,shame,us,all,[END]
arya,stopped,at,the,door,and,turned,back,biting,her,lip,[END]
the,tears,were,running,down,her,cheeks,now,[END]
she,managed,a,stiff,little,bow,to,myrcella,[END]
by,your,leave,my,lady,[END]
myrcella,blinked,at,her,and,looked,to,her,ladies,for,guidance,[END]
but,if,she,was,uncertain,septa,mordane,was,not,[END]
just,where,do,you,think,you,are,going,arya,the,septa,demanded,[END]
arya,glared,at,her,[END]
i,have,to,go,shoe,a,horse,she,said,sweetly,taking,a,brief,satisfaction,in,the,shock,on,the,septa,s,face,[END]
then,she,whirled,and,made,her,exit,running,down,the,steps,as,fast,as,her,feet,would,take,her,[END]
it,wasn,t,fair,[END]
sansa,had,everything,[END]
sansa,was,two,years,older,maybe,by,the,time,arya,had,been,born,there,had,been,nothing,left,[END]
often,it,felt,that,way,[END]
sansa,could,sew,and,dance,and,sing,[END]
she,wrote,poetry,[END]
she,knew,how,to,dress,[END]
she,played,the,high,harp,and,the,bells,[END]
worse,she,was,beautiful,[END]
sansa,had,gotten,their,mother,s,fine,high,cheekbones,and,the,thick,auburn,hair,of,the,tullys,[END]
arya,took,after,their,lord,father,[END]
her,hair,was,a,lusterless,brown,and,her,face,was,long,and,solemn,[END]
jeyne,used,to,call,her,arya,horseface,and,neigh,whenever,she,came,near,[END]
it,hurt,that,the,one,thing,arya,could,do,better,than,her,sister,was,ride,a,horse,[END]
well,that,and,manage,a,household,[END]
sansa,had,never,had,much,of,a,head,for,figures,[END]
if,she,did,marry,prince,joff,arya,hoped,for,his,sake,that,he,had,a,good,steward,[END]
nymeria,was,waiting,for,her,in,the,guardroom,at,the,base,of,the,stairs,[END]
she,bounded,to,her,feet,as,soon,as,she,caught,sight,of,arya,[END]
arya,grinned,[END]
the,wolf,pup,loved,her,even,if,no,one,else,did,[END]
they,went,everywhere,together,and,nymeria,slept,in,her,room,at,the,foot,of,her,bed,[END]
if,mother,had,not,forbidden,it,arya,would,gladly,have,taken,the,wolf,with,her,to,needlework,[END]
let,septa,mordane,complain,about,her,stitches,then,[END]
nymeria,nipped,eagerly,at,her,hand,as,arya,untied,her,[END]
she,had,yellow,eyes,[END]
when,they,caught,the,sunlight,they,gleamed,like,two,golden,coins,[END]
arya,had,named,her,after,the,warrior,queen,of,the,rhoyne,who,had,led,her,people,across,the,narrow,sea,[END]
that,had,been,a,great,scandal,too,[END]
sansa,of,course,had,named,her,pup,lady,arya,made,a,face,and,hugged,the,wolfling,tight,[END]
nymeria,licked,her,ear,and,she,giggled,[END]
by,now,septa,mordane,would,certainly,have,sent,word,to,her,lady,mother,[END]
if,she,went,to,her,room,they,would,find,her,[END]
arya,did,not,care,to,be,found,[END]
she,had,a,better,notion,[END]
the,boys,were,at,practice,in,the,yard,[END]
she,wanted,to,see,robb,put,gallant,prince,joffrey,flat,on,his,back,[END]
come,she,whispered,to,nymeria,[END]
she,got,up,and,ran,the,wolf,coming,hard,at,her,heels,[END]
there,was,a,window,in,the,covered,bridge,between,the,armory,and,the,great,keep,where,you,had,a,view,of,the,whole,yard,[END]
that,was,where,they,headed,[END]
they,arrived,flushed,and,breathless,to,find,jon,seated,on,the,sill,one,leg,drawn,up,languidly,to,his,chin,[END]
he,was,watching,the,action,so,absorbed,that,he,seemed,unaware,of,her,approach,until,his,white,wolf,moved,to,meet,them,[END]
nymeria,stalked,closer,on,wary,feet,[END]
ghost,already,larger,than,his,litter,mates,smelled,her,gave,her,ear,a,careful,nip,and,settled,back,down,[END]
jon,gave,her,a,curious,look,[END]
shouldn,t,you,be,working,on,your,stitches,little,sister,[END]
arya,made,a,face,at,him,[END]
i,wanted,to,see,them,fight,[END]
he,smiled,[END]
come,here,then,[END]
arya,climbed,up,on,the,window,and,sat,beside,him,to,a,chorus,of,thuds,and,grunts,from,the,yard,below,[END]
to,her,disappointment,it,was,the,younger,boys,drilling,[END]
bran,was,so,heavily,padded,he,looked,as,though,he,had,belted,on,a,featherbed,and,prince,tommen,who,was,plump,to,begin,with,seemed,positively,round,[END]
they,were,huffing,and,puffing,and,hitting,at,each,other,with,padded,wooden,swords,under,the,watchful,eye,of,old,ser,rodrik,cassel,the,master-at-arms,a,great,stout,keg,of,a,man,with,magnificent,white,cheek,whiskers,[END]
a,dozen,spectators,man,and,boy,were,calling,out,encouragement,robb,s,voice,the,loudest,among,them,[END]
she,spotted,theon,greyjoy,beside,him,his,black,doublet,emblazoned,with,the,golden,kraken,of,his,house,a,look,of,wry,contempt,on,his,face,[END]
both,of,the,combatants,were,staggering,[END]
arya,judged,that,they,had,been,at,it,awhile,[END]
a,shade,more,exhausting,than,needlework,jon,observed,[END]
a,shade,more,fun,than,needlework,arya,gave,back,at,him,[END]
jon,grinned,reached,over,and,messed,up,her,hair,[END]
arya,flushed,[END]
they,had,always,been,close,[END]
jon,had,their,father,s,face,as,she,did,[END]
they,were,the,only,ones,[END]
robb,and,sansa,and,bran,and,even,little,rickon,all,took,after,the,tullys,with,easy,smiles,and,fire,in,their,hair,[END]
when,arya,had,been,little,she,had,been,afraid,that,meant,that,she,was,a,bastard,too,[END]
it,had,been,jon,she,had,gone,to,in,her,fear,and,jon,who,had,reassured,her,[END]
why,aren,t,you,down,in,the,yard,arya,asked,him,[END]
he,gave,her,a,half,smile,[END]
bastards,are,not,allowed,to,damage,young,princes,he,said,[END]
any,bruises,they,take,in,the,practice,yard,must,come,from,trueborn,swords,[END]
oh,arya,felt,abashed,[END]
she,should,have,realized,[END]
for,the,second,time,today,arya,reflected,that,life,was,not,fair,[END]
she,watched,her,little,brother,whack,at,tommen,[END]
i,could,do,just,as,good,as,bran,she,said,[END]
he,s,only,seven,[END]
i,m,nine,[END]
jon,looked,her,over,with,all,his,fourteen-year-old,wisdom,[END]
you,re,too,skinny,he,said,[END]
he,took,her,arm,to,feel,her,muscle,[END]
then,he,sighed,and,shook,his,head,[END]
i,doubt,you,could,even,lift,a,longsword,little,sister,never,mind,swing,one,[END]
arya,snatched,back,her,arm,and,glared,at,him,[END]
jon,messed,up,her,hair,again,[END]
they,watched,bran,and,tommen,circle,each,other,[END]
you,see,prince,joffrey,jon,asked,[END]
she,hadn,t,not,at,first,glance,but,when,she,looked,again,she,found,him,to,the,back,under,the,shade,of,the,high,stone,wall,[END]
he,was,surrounded,by,men,she,did,not,recognize,young,squires,in,the,livery,of,lannister,and,baratheon,strangers,all,[END]
there,were,a,few,older,men,among,them,knights,she,surmised,[END]

arya,looked,[END]
an,ornate,shield,had,been,embroidered,on,the,prince,s,padded,surcoat,[END]
no,doubt,the,needlework,was,exquisite,[END]
the,arms,were,divided,down,the,middle,on,one,side,was,the,crowned,stag,of,the,royal,house,on,the,other,the,lion,of,lannister,[END]
the,lannisters,are,proud,jon,observed,[END]

he,makes,his,mother,s,house,equal,in,honor,to,the,king,s,[END]
the,woman,is,important,too,arya,protested,[END]
jon,chuckled,[END]
perhaps,you,should,do,the,same,thing,little,sister,[END]
wed,tully,to,stark,in,your,arms,[END]
a,wolf,with,a,fish,in,its,mouth,it,made,her,laugh,[END]
that,would,look,silly,[END]
besides,if,a,girl,can,t,fight,why,should,she,have,a,coat,of,arms,[END]
jon,shrugged,[END]
girls,get,the,arms,but,not,the,swords,[END]
bastards,get,the,swords,but,not,the,arms,[END]
i,did,not,make,the,rules,little,sister,[END]
there,was,a,shout,from,the,courtyard,below,[END]
prince,tommen,was,rolling,in,the,dust,trying,to,get,up,and,failing,[END]
all,the,padding,made,him,look,like,a,turtle,on,its,back,[END]

joffrey,moved,into,the,sunlight,in,response,to,rodrik,s,summons,[END]
his,hair,shone,like,spun,gold,[END]

the,wolfling,was,smarter,than,any,of,the,hounds,in,his,father,s,kennel,and,bran,would,have,sworn,he,understood,every,word,that,was,said,to,him,but,he,showed,very,little,interest,in,chasing,sticks,[END]

he,had,tried,a,hundred,names,in,the,last,fortnight,but,none,of,them,sounded,right,[END]
finally,he,got,tired,of,the,stick,game,and,decided,to,go,climbing,[END]
he,hadn,t,been,up,to,the,broken,tower,for,weeks,with,everything,that,had,happened,and,this,might,be,his,last,chance,[END]
he,raced,across,the,godswood,taking,the,long,way,around,to,avoid,the,pool,where,the,heart,tree,grew,[END]

the,wolf,did,as,he,was,told,[END]
bran,scratched,him,behind,the,ears,then,turned,away,jumped,grabbed,a,low,branch,and,pulled,himself,up,[END]

you,re,worse,than,mother,the,howling,chased,him,all,the,way,up,the,tree,until,finally,he,jumped,off,onto,the,armory,roof,and,out,of,sight,[END]
the,rooftops,of,winterfell,were,bran,s,second,home,[END]
his,mother,often,said,that,bran,could,climb,before,he,could,walk,[END]
bran,could,not,remember,when,he,first,learned,to,walk,but,he,could,not,remember,when,he,started,to,climb,either,so,he,supposed,it,must,be,true,[END]
to,a,boy,winterfell,was,a,grey,stone,labyrinth,of,walls,and,towers,and,courtyards,and,tunnels,spreading,out,in,all,directions,[END]
in,the,older,parts,of,the,castle,the,halls,slanted,up,and,down,so,that,you,couldn,t,even,be,sure,what,floor,you,were,on,[END]
the,place,had,grown,over,the,centuries,like,some,monstrous,stone,tree,maester,luwin,told,him,once,and,its,branches,were,gnarled,and,thick,and,twisted,its,roots,sunk,deep,into,the,earth,[END]
when,he,got,out,from,under,it,and,scrambled,up,near,the,sky,bran,could,see,all,of,winterfell,in,a,glance,[END]
he,liked,the,way,it,looked,spread,out,beneath,him,only,birds,wheeling,over,his,head,while,all,the,life,of,the,castle,went,on,below,[END]
bran,could,perch,for,hours,among,the,shapeless,rain-worn,gargoyles,that,brooded,over,the,first,keep,watching,it,all,the,men,drilling,with,wood,and,steel,in,the,yard,the,cooks,tending,their,vegetables,in,the,glass,garden,restless,dogs,running,back,and,forth,in,the,kennels,the,silence,of,the,godswood,the,girls,gossiping,beside,the,washing,well,[END]
it,made,him,feel,like,he,was,lord,of,the,castle,in,a,way,even,robb,would,never,know,[END]
it,taught,him,winterfell,s,secrets,too,[END]
the,builders,had,not,even,leveled,the,earth,there,were,hills,and,valleys,behind,the,walls,of,winterfell,[END]
there,was,a,covered,bridge,that,went,from,the,fourth,floor,of,the,bell,tower,across,to,the,second,floor,of,the,rookery,[END]
bran,knew,about,that,[END]
and,he,knew,you,could,get,inside,the,inner,wall,by,the,south,gate,climb,three,floors,and,run,all,the,way,around,winterfell,through,a,narrow,tunnel,in,the,stone,and,then,come,out,on,ground,level,at,the,north,gate,with,a,hundred,feet,of,wall,looming,over,you,[END]
even,maester,luwin,didn,t,know,that,bran,was,convinced,[END]
his,mother,was,terrified,that,one,day,bran,would,slip,off,a,wall,and,kill,himself,[END]
he,told,her,that,he,wouldn,t,but,she,never,believed,him,[END]
once,she,made,him,promise,that,he,would,stay,on,the,ground,[END]
he,had,managed,to,keep,that,promise,for,almost,a,fortnight,miserable,every,day,until,one,night,he,had,gone,out,the,window,of,his,bedroom,when,his,brothers,were,fast,asleep,[END]
he,confessed,his,crime,the,next,day,in,a,fit,of,guilt,[END]
lord,eddard,ordered,him,to,the,godswood,to,cleanse,himself,[END]
guards,were,posted,to,see,that,bran,remained,there,alone,all,night,to,reflect,on,his,disobedience,[END]
the,next,morning,bran,was,nowhere,to,be,seen,[END]
they,finally,found,him,fast,asleep,in,the,upper,branches,of,the,tallest,sentinel,in,the,grove,[END]
as,angry,as,he,was,his,father,could,not,help,but,laugh,[END]
you,re,not,my,son,he,told,bran,when,they,fetched,him,down,you,re,a,squirrel,[END]
so,be,it,[END]
if,you,must,climb,then,climb,but,try,not,to,let,your,mother,see,you,[END]
bran,did,his,best,although,he,did,not,think,he,ever,really,fooled,her,[END]
since,his,father,would,not,forbid,it,she,turned,to,others,[END]
old,nan,told,him,a,story,about,a,bad,little,boy,who,climbed,too,high,and,was,struck,down,by,lightning,and,how,afterward,the,crows,came,to,peck,out,his,eyes,[END]
bran,was,not,impressed,[END]
there,were,crows,nests,atop,the,broken,tower,where,no,one,ever,went,but,him,and,sometimes,he,filled,his,pockets,with,corn,before,he,climbed,up,there,and,the,crows,ate,it,right,out,of,his,hand,[END]
none,of,them,had,ever,shown,the,slightest,bit,of,interest,in,pecking,out,his,eyes,[END]
later,maester,luwin,built,a,little,pottery,boy,and,dressed,him,in,bran,s,clothes,and,flung,him,off,the,wall,into,the,yard,below,to,demonstrate,what,would,happen,to,bran,if,he,fell,[END]
that,had,been,fun,but,afterward,bran,just,looked,at,the,maester,and,said,i,m,not,made,of,clay,[END]
and,anyhow,i,never,fall,[END]
then,for,a,while,the,guards,would,chase,him,whenever,they,saw,him,on,the,roofs,and,try,to,haul,him,down,[END]
that,was,the,best,time,of,all,[END]
it,was,like,playing,a,game,with,his,brothers,except,that,bran,always,won,[END]
none,of,the,guards,could,climb,half,so,well,as,bran,not,even,jory,[END]
most,of,the,time,they,never,saw,him,anyway,[END]
people,never,looked,up,[END]
that,was,another,thing,he,liked,about,climbing,it,was,almost,like,being,invisible,[END]
he,liked,how,it,felt,too,pulling,himself,up,a,wall,stone,by,stone,fingers,and,toes,digging,hard,into,the,small,crevices,between,[END]
he,always,took,off,his,boots,and,went,barefoot,when,he,climbed,it,made,him,feel,as,if,he,had,four,hands,instead,of,two,[END]
he,liked,the,deep,sweet,ache,it,left,in,the,muscles,afterward,[END]
he,liked,the,way,the,air,tasted,way,up,high,sweet,and,cold,as,a,winter,peach,[END]
he,liked,the,birds,the,crows,in,the,broken,tower,the,tiny,little,sparrows,that,nested,in,cracks,between,the,stones,the,ancient,owl,that,slept,in,the,dusty,loft,above,the,old,armory,[END]
bran,knew,them,all,[END]
most,of,all,he,liked,going,places,that,no,one,else,could,go,and,seeing,the,grey,sprawl,of,winterfell,in,a,way,that,no,one,else,ever,saw,it,[END]
it,made,the,whole,castle,bran,s,secret,place,[END]
his,favorite,haunt,was,the,broken,tower,[END]
once,it,had,been,a,watchtower,the,tallest,in,winterfell,[END]
a,long,time,ago,a,hundred,years,before,even,his,father,had,been,born,a,lightning,strike,had,set,it,afire,[END]
the,top,third,of,the,structure,had,collapsed,inward,and,the,tower,had,never,been,rebuilt,[END]
sometimes,his,father,sent,ratters,into,the,base,of,the,tower,to,clean,out,the,nests,they,always,found,among,the,jumble,of,fallen,stones,and,charred,and,rotten,beams,[END]
but,no,one,ever,got,up,to,the,jagged,top,of,the,structure,now,except,for,bran,and,the,crows,[END]
he,knew,two,ways,to,get,there,[END]
you,could,climb,straight,up,the,side,of,the,tower,itself,but,the,stones,were,loose,the,mortar,that,held,them,together,long,gone,to,ash,and,bran,never,liked,to,put,his,full,weight,on,them,[END]
the,best,way,was,to,start,from,the,godswood,shinny,up,the,tall,sentinel,and,cross,over,the,armory,and,the,guards,hall,leaping,roof,to,roof,barefoot,so,the,guards,wouldn,t,hear,you,overhead,[END]
that,brought,you,up,to,the,blind,side,of,the,first,keep,the,oldest,part,of,the,castle,a,squat,round,fortress,that,was,taller,than,it,looked,[END]
only,rats,and,spiders,lived,there,now,but,the,old,stones,still,made,for,good,climbing,[END]
you,could,go,straight,up,to,where,the,gargoyles,leaned,out,blindly,over,empty,space,and,swing,from,gargoyle,to,gargoyle,hand,over,hand,around,to,the,north,side,[END]
from,there,if,you,really,stretched,you,could,reach,out,and,pull,yourself,over,to,the,broken,tower,where,it,leaned,close,[END]
the,last,part,was,the,scramble,up,the,blackened,stones,to,the,eyrie,no,more,than,ten,feet,and,then,the,crows,would,come,round,to,see,if,you,d,brought,any,corn,[END]
bran,was,moving,from,gargoyle,to,gargoyle,with,the,ease,of,long,practice,when,he,heard,the,voices,[END]
he,was,so,startled,he,almost,lost,his,grip,[END]
the,first,keep,had,been,empty,all,his,life,[END]
i,do,not,like,it,a,woman,was,saying,[END]
there,was,a,row,of,windows,beneath,him,and,the,voice,was,drifting,out,of,the,last,window,on,this,side,[END]
you,should,be,the,hand,[END]
gods,forbid,a,man,s,voice,replied,lazily,[END]
it,s,not,an,honor,i,d,want,[END]
there,s,far,too,much,work,involved,[END]
bran,hung,listening,suddenly,afraid,to,go,on,[END]

it,s,a,wonder,lysa,was,not,here,to,greet,us,with,her,accusations,[END]
bran,looked,down,[END]
there,was,a,narrow,ledge,beneath,the,window,only,a,few,inches,wide,[END]

the,world,looked,strange,upside,down,[END]
a,courtyard,swam,dizzily,below,him,its,stones,still,wet,with,melted,snow,[END]

inside,the,room,a,man,and,a,woman,were,wrestling,[END]

everything,happened,at,once,then,[END]
the,woman,pushed,the,man,away,wildly,shouting,and,pointing,[END]
bran,tried,to,pull,himself,up,bending,double,as,he,reached,for,the,gargoyle,[END]
he,was,in,too,much,of,a,hurry,[END]
his,hand,scraped,uselessly,across,smooth,stone,and,in,his,panic,his,legs,slipped,and,suddenly,he,was,falling,[END]
there,was,an,instant,of,vertigo,a,sickening,lurch,as,the,window,flashed,past,[END]

screaming,bran,went,backward,out,the,window,into,empty,air,[END]
there,was,nothing,to,grab,on,to,[END]
the,courtyard,rushed,up,to,meet,him,[END]
somewhere,off,in,the,distance,a,wolf,was,howling,[END]
crows,circled,the,broken,tower,waiting,for,corn,[END]
tyrion,[END]
somewhere,in,the,great,stone,maze,of,winterfell,a,wolf,howled,[END]
the,sound,hung,over,the,castle,like,a,flag,of,mourning,[END]
tyrion,lannister,looked,up,from,his,books,and,shivered,though,the,library,was,snug,and,warm,[END]
something,about,the,howling,of,a,wolf,took,a,man,right,out,of,his,here,and,now,and,left,him,in,a,dark,forest,of,the,mind,running,naked,before,the,pack,[END]
when,the,direwolf,howled,again,tyrion,shut,the,heavy,leather-bound,cover,on,the,book,he,was,reading,a,hundred-year-old,discourse,on,the,changing,of,the,seasons,by,a,long-dead,maester,[END]
he,covered,a,yawn,with,the,back,of,his,hand,[END]

he,had,been,at,it,all,night,but,that,was,nothing,new,[END]
tyrion,lannister,was,not,much,a,one,for,sleeping,[END]
his,legs,were,stiff,and,sore,as,he,eased,down,off,the,bench,[END]
he,massaged,some,life,back,into,them,and,limped,heavily,to,the,table,where,the,septon,was,snoring,softly,his,head,pillowed,on,an,open,book,in,front,of,him,[END]

patiently,tyrion,repeated,his,instructions,then,clapped,the,septon,on,the,shoulder,and,left,him,to,his,tasks,[END]
outside,tyrion,swallowed,a,lungful,of,the,cold,morning,air,and,began,his,laborious,descent,of,the,steep,stone,steps,that,corkscrewed,around,the,exterior,of,the,library,tower,[END]
it,was,slow,going,the,steps,were,cut,high,and,narrow,while,his,legs,were,short,and,twisted,[END]
the,rising,sun,had,not,yet,cleared,the,walls,of,winterfell,but,the,men,were,already,hard,at,it,in,the,yard,below,[END]
sandor,clegane,s,rasping,voice,drifted,up,to,him,[END]
the,boy,is,a,long,time,dying,[END]
i,wish,he,would,be,quicker,about,it,[END]
tyrion,glanced,down,and,saw,the,hound,standing,with,young,joffrey,as,squires,swarmed,around,them,[END]
at,least,he,dies,quietly,the,prince,replied,[END]
it,s,the,wolf,that,makes,the,noise,[END]
i,could,scarce,sleep,last,night,[END]
clegane,cast,a,long,shadow,across,the,hard-packed,earth,as,his,squire,lowered,the,black,helm,over,his,head,[END]
i,could,silence,the,creature,if,it,please,you,he,said,through,his,open,visor,[END]
his,boy,placed,a,longsword,in,his,hand,[END]
he,tested,the,weight,of,it,slicing,at,the,cold,morning,air,[END]
behind,him,the,yard,rang,to,the,clangor,of,steel,on,steel,[END]
the,notion,seemed,to,delight,the,prince,[END]
send,a,dog,to,kill,a,dog,he,exclaimed,[END]
winterfell,is,so,infested,with,wolves,the,starks,would,never,miss,one,[END]
tyrion,hopped,off,the,last,step,onto,the,yard,[END]
i,beg,to,differ,nephew,he,said,[END]

unlike,some,princes,i,might,name,[END]
joffrey,had,the,grace,at,least,to,blush,[END]
a,voice,from,nowhere,sandor,said,[END]
he,peered,through,his,helm,looking,this,way,and,that,[END]
spirits,of,the,air,[END]
the,prince,laughed,as,he,always,laughed,when,his,bodyguard,did,this,mummer,s,farce,[END]
tyrion,was,used,to,it,[END]
down,here,[END]
the,tall,man,peered,down,at,the,ground,and,pretended,to,notice,him,[END]
the,little,lord,tyrion,he,said,[END]
my,pardons,[END]
i,did,not,see,you,standing,there,[END]
i,am,in,no,mood,for,your,insolence,today,tyrion,turned,to,his,nephew,[END]
joffrey,it,is,past,time,you,called,on,lord,eddard,and,his,lady,to,offer,them,your,comfort,[END]
joffrey,looked,as,petulant,as,only,a,boy,prince,can,look,[END]
what,good,will,my,comfort,do,them,[END]
none,tyrion,said,[END]
yet,it,is,expected,of,you,[END]
your,absence,has,been,noted,[END]
the,stark,boy,is,nothing,to,me,joffrey,said,[END]
i,cannot,abide,the,wailing,of,women,[END]
tyrion,lannister,reached,up,and,slapped,his,nephew,hard,across,the,face,[END]
the,boy,s,cheek,began,to,redden,[END]
one,word,tyrion,said,and,i,will,hit,you,again,[END]
i,m,going,to,tell,mother,joffrey,exclaimed,[END]
tyrion,hit,him,again,[END]
now,both,cheeks,flamed,[END]
you,tell,your,mother,tyrion,told,him,[END]
but,first,you,get,yourself,to,lord,and,lady,stark,and,you,fall,to,your,knees,in,front,of,them,and,you,tell,them,how,very,sorry,you,are,and,that,you,are,at,their,service,if,there,is,the,slightest,thing,you,can,do,for,them,or,theirs,in,this,desperate,hour,and,that,all,your,prayers,go,with,them,[END]
do,you,understand,[END]
do,you,[END]
the,boy,looked,as,though,he,was,going,to,cry,[END]
instead,he,managed,a,weak,nod,[END]
then,he,turned,and,fled,headlong,from,the,yard,holding,his,cheek,[END]
tyrion,watched,him,run,[END]
a,shadow,fell,across,his,face,[END]
he,turned,to,find,clegane,looming,overhead,like,a,cliff,[END]
his,soot-dark,armor,seemed,to,blot,out,the,sun,[END]
he,had,lowered,the,visor,on,his,helm,[END]
it,was,fashioned,in,the,likeness,of,a,snarling,black,hound,fearsome,to,behold,but,tyrion,had,always,thought,it,a,great,improvement,over,clegane,s,hideously,burned,face,[END]
the,prince,will,remember,that,little,lord,the,hound,warned,him,[END]
the,helm,turned,his,laugh,into,a,hollow,rumble,[END]
i,pray,he,does,tyrion,lannister,replied,[END]
if,he,forgets,be,a,good,dog,and,remind,him,he,glanced,around,the,courtyard,[END]
do,you,know,where,i,might,find,my,brother,[END]
breaking,fast,with,the,queen,[END]
ah,tyrion,said,[END]
he,gave,sandor,clegane,a,perfunctory,nod,and,walked,away,as,briskly,as,his,stunted,legs,would,carry,him,whistling,[END]
he,pitied,the,first,knight,to,try,the,hound,today,[END]
the,man,did,have,a,temper,[END]
a,cold,cheerless,meal,had,been,laid,out,in,the,morning,room,of,the,guest,house,[END]
jaime,sat,at,table,with,cersei,and,the,children,talking,in,low,hushed,voices,[END]
is,robert,still,abed,tyrion,asked,as,he,seated,himself,uninvited,at,the,table,[END]
his,sister,peered,at,him,with,the,same,expression,of,faint,distaste,she,had,worn,since,the,day,he,was,born,[END]
the,king,has,not,slept,at,all,she,told,him,[END]
he,is,with,lord,eddard,[END]
he,has,taken,their,sorrow,deeply,to,heart,[END]
he,has,a,large,heart,our,robert,jaime,said,with,a,lazy,smile,[END]
there,was,very,little,that,jaime,took,seriously,[END]
tyrion,knew,that,about,his,brother,and,forgave,it,[END]
during,all,the,terrible,long,years,of,his,childhood,only,jaime,had,ever,shown,him,the,smallest,measure,of,affection,or,respect,and,for,that,tyrion,was,willing,to,forgive,him,most,anything,[END]
a,servant,approached,[END]
bread,tyrion,told,him,and,two,of,those,little,fish,and,a,mug,of,that,good,dark,beer,to,wash,them,down,[END]
oh,and,some,bacon,[END]
burn,it,until,it,turns,black,the,man,bowed,and,moved,off,[END]
tyrion,turned,back,to,his,siblings,[END]
twins,male,and,female,[END]
they,looked,very,much,the,part,this,morning,[END]
both,had,chosen,a,deep,green,that,matched,their,eyes,[END]
their,blond,curls,were,all,a,fashionable,tumble,and,gold,ornaments,shone,at,wrists,and,fingers,and,throats,[END]
tyrion,wondered,what,it,would,be,like,to,have,a,twin,and,decided,that,he,would,rather,not,know,[END]
bad,enough,to,face,himself,in,a,looking,glass,every,day,[END]
another,him,was,a,thought,too,dreadful,to,contemplate,[END]
prince,tommen,spoke,up,[END]
do,you,have,news,of,bran,uncle,[END]
i,stopped,by,the,sickroom,last,night,tyrion,announced,[END]
there,was,no,change,[END]
the,maester,thought,that,a,hopeful,sign,[END]
i,don,t,want,brandon,to,die,tommen,said,timorously,[END]
he,was,a,sweet,boy,[END]
not,like,his,brother,but,then,jaime,and,tyrion,were,somewhat,less,than,peas,in,a,pod,themselves,[END]
lord,eddard,had,a,brother,named,brandon,as,well,jaime,mused,[END]
one,of,the,hostages,murdered,by,targaryen,[END]
it,seems,to,be,an,unlucky,name,[END]
oh,not,so,unlucky,as,all,that,surely,tyrion,said,[END]
the,servant,brought,his,plate,[END]
he,ripped,off,a,chunk,of,black,bread,[END]
cersei,was,studying,him,warily,[END]
what,do,you,mean,[END]
tyrion,gave,her,a,crooked,smile,[END]
why,only,that,tommen,may,get,his,wish,[END]
the,maester,thinks,the,boy,may,yet,live,he,took,a,sip,of,beer,[END]
myrcella,gave,a,happy,gasp,and,tommen,smiled,nervously,but,it,was,not,the,children,tyrion,was,watching,[END]
the,glance,that,passed,between,jaime,and,cersei,lasted,no,more,than,a,second,but,he,did,not,miss,it,[END]
then,his,sister,dropped,her,gaze,to,the,table,[END]
that,is,no,mercy,[END]
these,northern,gods,are,cruel,to,let,the,child,linger,in,such,pain,[END]
what,were,the,maester,s,words,jaime,asked,[END]
the,bacon,crunched,when,he,bit,into,it,[END]
tyrion,chewed,thoughtfully,for,a,moment,and,said,he,thinks,that,if,the,boy,were,going,to,die,he,would,have,done,so,already,[END]
it,has,been,four,days,with,no,change,[END]
will,bran,get,better,uncle,little,myrcella,asked,[END]
she,had,all,of,her,mother,s,beauty,and,none,of,her,nature,[END]
his,back,is,broken,little,one,tyrion,told,her,[END]
the,fall,shattered,his,legs,as,well,[END]
they,keep,him,alive,with,honey,and,water,or,he,would,starve,to,death,[END]
perhaps,if,he,wakes,he,will,be,able,to,eat,real,food,but,he,will,never,walk,again,[END]
if,he,wakes,cersei,repeated,[END]
is,that,likely,[END]
the,gods,alone,know,tyrion,told,her,[END]
the,maester,only,hopes,he,chewed,some,more,bread,[END]
i,would,swear,that,wolf,of,his,is,keeping,the,boy,alive,[END]
the,creature,is,outside,his,window,day,and,night,howling,[END]
every,time,they,chase,it,away,it,returns,[END]
the,maester,said,they,closed,the,window,once,to,shut,out,the,noise,and,bran,seemed,to,weaken,[END]
when,they,opened,it,again,his,heart,beat,stronger,[END]
the,queen,shuddered,[END]
there,is,something,unnatural,about,those,animals,she,said,[END]
they,are,dangerous,[END]
i,will,not,have,any,of,them,coming,south,with,us,[END]
jaime,said,you,ll,have,a,hard,time,stopping,them,sister,[END]
they,follow,those,girls,everywhere,[END]
tyrion,started,on,his,fish,[END]

what,me,celibate,[END]
the,whores,would,go,begging,from,dorne,to,casterly,rock,[END]
no,i,just,want,to,stand,on,top,of,the,wall,and,piss,off,the,edge,of,the,world,[END]
cersei,stood,abruptly,[END]
the,children,don,t,need,to,hear,this,filth,[END]
tommen,myrcella,come,she,strode,briskly,from,the,morning,room,her,train,and,her,pups,trailing,behind,her,[END]
jaime,lannister,regarded,his,brother,thoughtfully,with,those,cool,green,eyes,[END]
stark,will,never,consent,to,leave,winterfell,with,his,son,lingering,in,the,shadow,of,death,[END]
he,will,if,robert,commands,it,tyrion,said,[END]
and,robert,will,command,it,[END]
there,is,nothing,lord,eddard,can,do,for,the,boy,in,any,case,[END]
he,could,end,his,torment,jaime,said,[END]
i,would,if,it,were,my,son,[END]
it,would,be,a,mercy,[END]
i,advise,against,putting,that,suggestion,to,lord,eddard,sweet,brother,tyrion,said,[END]
he,would,not,take,it,kindly,[END]
even,if,the,boy,does,live,he,will,be,a,cripple,[END]
worse,than,a,cripple,[END]
a,grotesque,[END]
give,me,a,good,clean,death,[END]
tyrion,replied,with,a,shrug,that,accentuated,the,twist,of,his,shoulders,[END]
speaking,for,the,grotesques,he,said,i,beg,to,differ,[END]
death,is,so,terribly,final,while,life,is,full,of,possibilities,[END]
jaime,smiled,[END]
you,are,a,perverse,little,imp,aren,t,you,[END]
oh,yes,tyrion,admitted,[END]
i,hope,the,boy,does,wake,[END]
i,would,be,most,interested,to,hear,what,he,might,have,to,say,[END]
his,brother,s,smile,curdled,like,sour,milk,[END]
tyrion,my,sweet,brother,he,said,darkly,there,are,times,when,you,give,me,cause,to,wonder,whose,side,you,are,on,[END]
tyrion,s,mouth,was,full,of,bread,and,fish,[END]
he,took,a,swallow,of,strong,black,beer,to,wash,it,all,down,and,grinned,up,wolfishly,at,jaime,[END]
why,jaime,my,sweet,brother,he,said,you,wound,me,[END]
you,know,how,much,i,love,my,family,[END]
jon,[END]
jon,climbed,the,steps,slowly,trying,not,to,think,that,this,might,be,the,last,time,ever,[END]
ghost,padded,silently,beside,him,[END]
outside,snow,swirled,through,the,castle,gates,and,the,yard,was,all,noise,and,chaos,but,inside,the,thick,stone,walls,it,was,still,warm,and,quiet,[END]

she,would,even,have,welcomed,the,conversation,of,illyrio,and,her,brother,but,they,were,too,far,below,to,hear,her,[END]

the,warriors,were,watching,too,[END]
one,of,them,finally,stepped,into,the,circle,grabbed,a,dancer,by,the,arm,pushed,her,down,to,the,ground,and,mounted,her,right,there,as,a,stallion,mounts,a,mare,[END]

as,the,hours,passed,the,terror,grew,in,dany,until,it,was,all,she,could,do,not,to,scream,[END]
she,was,afraid,of,the,dothraki,whose,ways,seemed,alien,and,monstrous,as,if,they,were,beasts,in,human,skins,and,not,true,men,at,all,[END]
she,was,afraid,of,her,brother,of,what,he,might,do,if,she,failed,him,[END]

she,thanked,him,with,all,her,heart,[END]
magister,illyrio,murmured,a,command,and,four,burly,slaves,hurried,forward,bearing,between,them,a,great,cedar,chest,bound,in,bronze,[END]
when,she,opened,it,she,found,piles,of,the,finest,velvets,and,damasks,the,free,cities,could,produce,and,resting,on,top,nestled,in,the,soft,cloth,three,huge,eggs,[END]
dany,gasped,[END]
they,were,the,most,beautiful,things,she,had,ever,seen,each,different,than,the,others,patterned,in,such,rich,colors,that,at,first,she,thought,they,were,crusted,with,jewels,and,so,large,it,took,both,of,her,hands,to,hold,one,[END]
she,lifted,it,delicately,expecting,that,it,would,be,made,of,some,fine,porcelain,or,delicate,enamel,or,even,blown,glass,but,it,was,much,heavier,than,that,as,if,it,were,all,of,solid,stone,[END]
the,surface,of,the,shell,was,covered,with,tiny,scales,and,as,she,turned,the,egg,between,her,fingers,they,shimmered,like,polished,metal,in,the,light,of,the,setting,sun,[END]
one,egg,was,a,deep,green,with,burnished,bronze,flecks,that,came,and,went,depending,on,how,dany,turned,it,[END]
another,was,pale,cream,streaked,with,gold,[END]
the,last,was,black,as,black,as,a,midnight,sea,yet,alive,with,scarlet,ripples,and,swirls,[END]

i,shall,treasure,them,always,dany,had,heard,tales,of,such,eggs,but,she,had,never,seen,one,nor,thought,to,see,one,[END]
it,was,a,truly,magnificent,gift,though,she,knew,that,illyrio,could,afford,to,be,lavish,[END]
he,had,collected,a,fortune,in,horses,and,slaves,for,his,part,in,selling,her,to,khal,drogo,[END]
the,khal,s,bloodriders,offered,her,the,traditional,three,weapons,and,splendid,weapons,they,were,[END]
haggo,gave,her,a,great,leather,whip,with,a,silver,handle,cohollo,a,magnificent,arakh,chased,in,gold,and,qotho,a,double-curved,dragonbone,bow,taller,than,she,was,[END]

and,last,of,all,khal,drogo,brought,forth,his,own,bride,gift,to,her,[END]
an,expectant,hush,rippled,out,from,the,center,of,the,camp,as,he,left,her,side,growing,until,it,had,swallowed,the,whole,khalasar,[END]
when,he,returned,the,dense,press,of,dothraki,gift-givers,parted,before,him,and,he,led,the,horse,to,her,[END]
she,was,a,young,filly,spirited,and,splendid,[END]
dany,knew,just,enough,about,horses,to,know,that,this,was,no,ordinary,animal,[END]
there,was,something,about,her,that,took,the,breath,away,[END]
she,was,grey,as,the,winter,sea,with,a,mane,like,silver,smoke,[END]
hesitantly,she,reached,out,and,stroked,the,horse,s,neck,ran,her,fingers,through,the,silver,of,her,mane,[END]
khal,drogo,said,something,in,dothraki,and,magister,illyrio,translated,[END]
silver,for,the,silver,of,your,hair,the,khal,says,[END]
she,s,beautiful,dany,murmured,[END]
she,is,the,pride,of,the,khalasar,illyrio,said,[END]
custom,decrees,that,the,khaleesi,must,ride,a,mount,worthy,of,her,place,by,the,side,of,the,khal,[END]
drogo,stepped,forward,and,put,his,hands,on,her,waist,[END]
he,lifted,her,up,as,easily,as,if,she,were,a,child,and,set,her,on,the,thin,dothraki,saddle,so,much,smaller,than,the,ones,she,was,used,to,[END]
dany,sat,there,uncertain,for,a,moment,[END]
no,one,had,told,her,about,this,part,[END]
what,should,i,do,she,asked,illyrio,[END]
it,was,ser,jorah,mormont,who,answered,[END]
take,the,reins,and,ride,[END]
you,need,not,go,far,[END]
nervously,dany,gathered,the,reins,in,her,hands,and,slid,her,feet,into,the,short,stirrups,[END]
she,was,only,a,fair,rider,she,had,spent,far,more,time,traveling,by,ship,and,wagon,and,palanquin,than,by,horseback,[END]
praying,that,she,would,not,fall,off,and,disgrace,herself,she,gave,the,filly,the,lightest,and,most,timid,touch,with,her,knees,[END]
and,for,the,first,time,in,hours,she,forgot,to,be,afraid,[END]
or,perhaps,it,was,for,the,first,time,ever,[END]
the,silver-grey,filly,moved,with,a,smooth,and,silken,gait,and,the,crowd,parted,for,her,every,eye,upon,them,[END]
dany,found,herself,moving,faster,than,she,had,intended,yet,somehow,it,was,exciting,rather,than,terrifying,[END]
the,horse,broke,into,a,trot,and,she,smiled,[END]
dothraki,scrambled,to,clear,a,path,[END]
the,slightest,pressure,with,her,legs,the,lightest,touch,on,the,reins,and,the,filly,responded,[END]
she,sent,it,into,a,gallop,and,now,the,dothraki,were,hooting,and,laughing,and,shouting,at,her,as,they,jumped,out,of,her,way,[END]
as,she,turned,to,ride,back,a,firepit,loomed,ahead,directly,in,her,path,[END]
they,were,hemmed,in,on,either,side,with,no,room,to,stop,[END]
a,daring,she,had,never,known,filled,daenerys,then,and,she,gave,the,filly,her,head,[END]
the,silver,horse,leapt,the,flames,as,if,she,had,wings,[END]
when,she,pulled,up,before,magister,illyrio,she,said,tell,khal,drogo,that,he,has,given,me,the,wind,the,fat,pentoshi,stroked,his,yellow,beard,as,he,repeated,her,words,in,dothraki,and,dany,saw,her,new,husband,smile,for,the,first,time,[END]
the,last,sliver,of,sun,vanished,behind,the,high,walls,of,pentos,to,the,west,just,then,[END]
dany,had,lost,all,track,of,time,[END]
khal,drogo,commanded,his,bloodriders,to,bring,forth,his,own,horse,a,lean,red,stallion,[END]
as,the,khal,was,saddling,the,horse,viserys,slid,close,to,dany,on,her,silver,dug,his,fingers,into,her,leg,and,said,please,him,sweet,sister,or,i,swear,you,will,see,the,dragon,wake,as,it,has,never,woken,before,[END]
the,fear,came,back,to,her,then,with,her,brother,s,words,[END]
she,felt,like,a,child,once,more,only,thirteen,and,all,alone,not,ready,for,what,was,about,to,happen,to,her,[END]
they,rode,out,together,as,the,stars,came,out,leaving,the,khalasar,and,the,grass,palaces,behind,[END]
khal,drogo,spoke,no,word,to,her,but,drove,his,stallion,at,a,hard,trot,through,the,gathering,dusk,[END]
the,tiny,silver,bells,in,his,long,braid,rang,softly,as,he,rode,[END]
i,am,the,blood,of,the,dragon,she,whispered,aloud,as,she,followed,trying,to,keep,her,courage,up,[END]
i,am,the,blood,of,the,dragon,[END]
i,am,the,blood,of,the,dragon,the,dragon,was,never,afraid,[END]
afterward,she,could,not,say,how,far,or,how,long,they,had,ridden,but,it,was,full,dark,when,they,stopped,at,a,grassy,place,beside,a,small,stream,[END]
drogo,swung,off,his,horse,and,lifted,her,down,from,hers,[END]
she,felt,as,fragile,as,glass,in,his,hands,her,limbs,as,weak,as,water,[END]
she,stood,there,helpless,and,trembling,in,her,wedding,silks,while,he,secured,the,horses,and,when,he,turned,to,look,at,her,she,began,to,cry,[END]
khal,drogo,stared,at,her,tears,his,face,strangely,empty,of,expression,[END]
no,he,said,[END]
he,lifted,his,hand,and,rubbed,away,the,tears,roughly,with,a,callused,thumb,[END]
you,speak,the,common,tongue,dany,said,in,wonder,[END]
no,he,said,again,[END]
perhaps,he,had,only,that,word,she,thought,but,it,was,one,word,more,than,she,had,known,he,had,and,somehow,it,made,her,feel,a,little,better,[END]
drogo,touched,her,hair,lightly,sliding,the,silver-blond,strands,between,his,fingers,and,murmuring,softly,in,dothraki,[END]
dany,did,not,understand,the,words,yet,there,was,warmth,in,the,tone,a,tenderness,she,had,never,expected,from,this,man,[END]
he,put,his,finger,under,her,chin,and,lifted,her,head,so,she,was,looking,up,into,his,eyes,[END]
drogo,towered,over,her,as,he,towered,over,everyone,[END]
taking,her,lightly,under,the,arms,he,lifted,her,and,seated,her,on,a,rounded,rock,beside,the,stream,[END]
then,he,sat,on,the,ground,facing,her,legs,crossed,beneath,him,their,faces,finally,at,a,height,[END]
no,he,said,[END]
is,that,the,only,word,you,know,she,asked,him,[END]
drogo,did,not,reply,[END]
his,long,heavy,braid,was,coiled,in,the,dirt,beside,him,[END]
he,pulled,it,over,his,right,shoulder,and,began,to,remove,the,bells,from,his,hair,one,by,one,[END]
after,a,moment,dany,leaned,forward,to,help,[END]
when,they,were,done,drogo,gestured,[END]
she,understood,[END]
slowly,carefully,she,began,to,undo,his,braid,[END]
it,took,a,long,time,[END]
all,the,while,he,sat,there,silently,watching,her,[END]
when,she,was,done,he,shook,his,head,and,his,hair,spread,out,behind,him,like,a,river,of,darkness,oiled,and,gleaming,[END]
she,had,never,seen,hair,so,long,so,black,so,thick,[END]
then,it,was,his,turn,[END]
he,began,to,undress,her,[END]
his,fingers,were,deft,and,strangely,tender,[END]
he,removed,her,silks,one,by,one,carefully,while,dany,sat,unmoving,silent,looking,at,his,eyes,[END]
when,he,bared,her,small,breasts,she,could,not,help,herself,[END]
she,averted,her,eyes,and,covered,herself,with,her,hands,[END]
no,drogo,said,[END]
he,pulled,her,hands,away,from,her,breasts,gently,but,firmly,then,lifted,her,face,again,to,make,her,look,at,him,[END]
no,he,repeated,[END]
no,she,echoed,back,at,him,[END]
he,stood,her,up,then,and,pulled,her,close,to,remove,the,last,of,her,silks,[END]
the,night,air,was,chilly,on,her,bare,skin,[END]
she,shivered,and,gooseflesh,covered,her,arms,and,legs,[END]
she,was,afraid,of,what,would,come,next,but,for,a,while,nothing,happened,[END]
khal,drogo,sat,with,his,legs,crossed,looking,at,her,drinking,in,her,body,with,his,eyes,[END]
after,a,while,he,began,to,touch,her,[END]
lightly,at,first,then,harder,[END]
she,could,sense,the,fierce,strength,in,his,hands,but,he,never,hurt,her,[END]
he,held,her,hand,in,his,own,and,brushed,her,fingers,one,by,one,[END]
he,ran,a,hand,gently,down,her,leg,[END]
he,stroked,her,face,tracing,the,curve,of,her,ears,running,a,finger,gently,around,her,mouth,[END]
he,put,both,hands,in,her,hair,and,combed,it,with,his,fingers,[END]
he,turned,her,around,massaged,her,shoulders,slid,a,knuckle,down,the,path,of,her,spine,[END]
it,seemed,as,if,hours,passed,before,his,hands,finally,went,to,her,breasts,[END]
he,stroked,the,soft,skin,underneath,until,it,tingled,[END]
he,circled,her,nipples,with,his,thumbs,pinched,them,between,thumb,and,forefinger,then,began,to,pull,at,her,very,lightly,at,first,then,more,insistently,until,her,nipples,stiffened,and,began,to,ache,[END]
he,stopped,then,and,drew,her,down,onto,his,lap,[END]
dany,was,flushed,and,breathless,her,heart,fluttering,in,her,chest,[END]
he,cupped,her,face,in,his,huge,hands,and,she,looked,into,his,eyes,[END]
no,he,said,and,she,knew,it,was,a,question,[END]
she,took,his,hand,and,moved,it,down,to,the,wetness,between,her,thighs,[END]

i,warn,you,lannister,you,ll,find,no,inns,at,the,wall,he,had,said,looking,down,on,him,[END]
no,doubt,you,ll,find,some,place,to,put,me,tyrion,had,replied,[END]
as,you,might,have,noticed,i,m,small,[END]
one,did,not,say,no,to,the,queen,s,brother,of,course,so,that,had,settled,the,matter,but,stark,had,not,been,happy,[END]
you,will,not,like,the,ride,i,promise,you,that,he,d,said,curtly,and,since,the,moment,they,set,out,he,had,done,all,he,could,to,live,up,to,that,promise,[END]
by,the,end,of,the,first,week,tyrion,s,thighs,were,raw,from,hard,riding,his,legs,were,cramping,badly,and,he,was,chilled,to,the,bone,[END]
he,did,not,complain,[END]
he,was,damned,if,he,would,give,benjen,stark,that,satisfaction,[END]
he,took,a,small,revenge,in,the,matter,of,his,riding,fur,a,tattered,bearskin,old,and,musty-smelling,[END]
stark,had,offered,it,to,him,in,an,excess,of,night,s,watch,gallantry,no,doubt,expecting,him,to,graciously,decline,[END]
tyrion,had,accepted,with,a,smile,[END]
he,had,brought,his,warmest,clothing,with,him,when,they,rode,out,of,winterfell,and,soon,discovered,that,it,was,nowhere,near,warm,enough,[END]
it,was,cold,up,here,and,growing,colder,[END]
the,nights,were,well,below,freezing,now,and,when,the,wind,blew,it,was,like,a,knife,cutting,right,through,his,warmest,woolens,[END]
by,now,stark,was,no,doubt,regretting,his,chivalrous,impulse,[END]
perhaps,he,had,learned,a,lesson,[END]
the,lannisters,never,declined,graciously,or,otherwise,[END]
the,lannisters,took,what,was,offered,[END]
farms,and,holdfasts,grew,scarcer,and,smaller,as,they,pressed,northward,ever,deeper,into,the,darkness,of,the,wolfswood,until,finally,there,were,no,more,roofs,to,shelter,under,and,they,were,thrown,back,on,their,own,resources,[END]
tyrion,was,never,much,use,in,making,a,camp,or,breaking,one,[END]
too,small,too,hobbled,too,in-the-way,[END]
so,while,stark,and,yoren,and,the,other,men,erected,rude,shelters,tended,the,horses,and,built,a,fire,it,became,his,custom,to,take,his,fur,and,a,wineskin,and,go,off,by,himself,to,read,[END]
on,the,eighteenth,night,of,their,journey,the,wine,was,a,rare,sweet,amber,from,the,summer,isles,that,he,had,brought,all,the,way,north,from,casterly,rock,and,the,book,a,rumination,on,the,history,and,properties,of,dragons,[END]
with,lord,eddard,stark,s,permission,tyrion,had,borrowed,a,few,rare,volumes,from,the,winterfell,library,and,packed,them,for,the,ride,north,[END]
he,found,a,comfortable,spot,just,beyond,the,noise,of,the,camp,beside,a,swift-running,stream,with,waters,clear,and,cold,as,ice,[END]
a,grotesquely,ancient,oak,provided,shelter,from,the,biting,wind,[END]
tyrion,curled,up,in,his,fur,with,his,back,against,the,trunk,took,a,sip,of,the,wine,and,began,to,read,about,the,properties,of,dragonbone,[END]
dragonbone,is,black,because,of,its,high,iron,content,the,book,told,him,[END]
it,is,strong,as,steel,yet,lighter,and,far,more,flexible,and,of,course,utterly,impervious,to,fire,[END]
dragonbone,bows,are,greatly,prized,by,the,dothraki,and,small,wonder,[END]
an,archer,so,armed,can,outrange,any,wooden,bow,[END]
tyrion,had,a,morbid,fascination,with,dragons,[END]
when,he,had,first,come,to,king,s,landing,for,his,sister,s,wedding,to,robert,baratheon,he,had,made,it,a,point,to,seek,out,the,dragon,skulls,that,had,hung,on,the,walls,of,targaryen,s,throne,room,[END]
king,robert,had,replaced,them,with,banners,and,tapestries,but,tyrion,had,persisted,until,he,found,the,skulls,in,the,dank,cellar,where,they,had,been,stored,[END]
he,had,expected,to,find,them,impressive,perhaps,even,frightening,[END]
he,had,not,thought,to,find,them,beautiful,[END]
yet,they,were,[END]
as,black,as,onyx,polished,smooth,so,the,bone,seemed,to,shimmer,in,the,light,of,his,torch,[END]
they,liked,the,fire,he,sensed,[END]
he,d,thrust,the,torch,into,the,mouth,of,one,of,the,larger,skulls,and,made,the,shadows,leap,and,dance,on,the,wall,behind,him,[END]
the,teeth,were,long,curving,knives,of,black,diamond,[END]
the,flame,of,the,torch,was,nothing,to,them,they,had,bathed,in,the,heat,of,far,greater,fires,[END]
when,he,had,moved,away,tyrion,could,have,sworn,that,the,beast,s,empty,eye,sockets,had,watched,him,go,[END]
there,were,nineteen,skulls,[END]
the,oldest,was,more,than,three,thousand,years,old,the,youngest,a,mere,century,and,a,half,[END]
the,most,recent,were,also,the,smallest,a,matched,pair,no,bigger,than,mastiff,s,skulls,and,oddly,misshapen,all,that,remained,of,the,last,two,hatchlings,born,on,dragonstone,[END]
they,were,the,last,of,the,targaryen,dragons,perhaps,the,last,dragons,anywhere,and,they,had,not,lived,very,long,[END]
from,there,the,skulls,ranged,upward,in,size,to,the,three,great,monsters,of,song,and,story,the,dragons,that,aegon,targaryen,and,his,sisters,had,unleashed,on,the,seven,kingdoms,of,old,[END]
the,singers,had,given,them,the,names,of,gods,balerion,meraxes,vhaghar,[END]
tyrion,had,stood,between,their,gaping,jaws,wordless,and,awed,[END]
you,could,have,ridden,a,horse,down,vhaghar,s,gullet,although,you,would,not,have,ridden,it,out,again,[END]
meraxes,was,even,bigger,[END]
and,the,greatest,of,them,balerion,the,black,dread,could,have,swallowed,an,aurochs,whole,or,even,one,of,the,hairy,mammoths,said,to,roam,the,cold,wastes,beyond,the,port,of,ibben,[END]
tyrion,stood,in,that,dank,cellar,for,a,long,time,staring,at,balerion,s,huge,empty-eyed,skull,until,his,torch,burned,low,trying,to,grasp,the,size,of,the,living,animal,to,imagine,how,it,must,have,looked,when,it,spread,its,great,black,wings,and,swept,across,the,skies,breathing,fire,[END]
his,own,remote,ancestor,king,loren,of,the,rock,had,tried,to,stand,against,the,fire,when,he,joined,with,king,mern,of,the,reach,to,oppose,the,targaryen,conquest,[END]
that,was,close,on,three,hundred,years,ago,when,the,seven,kingdoms,were,kingdoms,and,not,mere,provinces,of,a,greater,realm,[END]
between,them,the,two,kings,had,six,hundred,banners,flying,five,thousand,mounted,knights,and,ten,times,as,many,freeriders,and,men-at-arms,[END]
aegon,dragonlord,had,perhaps,a,fifth,that,number,the,chroniclers,said,and,most,of,those,were,conscripts,from,the,ranks,of,the,last,king,he,had,slain,their,loyalties,uncertain,[END]
the,hosts,met,on,the,broad,plains,of,the,reach,amidst,golden,fields,of,wheat,ripe,for,harvest,[END]
when,the,two,kings,charged,the,targaryen,army,shivered,and,shattered,and,began,to,run,[END]
for,a,few,moments,the,chroniclers,wrote,the,conquest,was,at,an,end,but,only,for,those,few,moments,before,aegon,targaryen,and,his,sisters,joined,the,battle,[END]
it,was,the,only,time,that,vhaghar,meraxes,and,balerion,were,all,unleashed,at,once,[END]
the,singers,called,it,the,field,of,fire,[END]
near,four,thousand,men,had,burned,that,day,among,them,king,mern,of,the,reach,[END]
king,loren,had,escaped,and,lived,long,enough,to,surrender,pledge,his,fealty,to,the,targaryens,and,beget,a,son,for,which,tyrion,was,duly,grateful,[END]
why,do,you,read,so,much,[END]
tyrion,looked,up,at,the,sound,of,the,voice,[END]
jon,snow,was,standing,a,few,feet,away,regarding,him,curiously,[END]
he,closed,the,book,on,a,finger,and,said,look,at,me,and,tell,me,what,you,see,[END]
the,boy,looked,at,him,suspiciously,[END]
is,this,some,kind,of,trick,[END]
i,see,you,[END]
tyrion,lannister,[END]
tyrion,sighed,[END]
you,are,remarkably,polite,for,a,bastard,snow,[END]
what,you,see,is,a,dwarf,[END]
you,are,what,twelve,[END]
fourteen,the,boy,said,[END]
fourteen,and,you,re,taller,than,i,will,ever,be,[END]
my,legs,are,short,and,twisted,and,i,walk,with,difficulty,[END]
i,require,a,special,saddle,to,keep,from,falling,off,my,horse,[END]
a,saddle,of,my,own,design,you,may,be,interested,to,know,[END]
it,was,either,that,or,ride,a,pony,[END]
my,arms,are,strong,enough,but,again,too,short,[END]
i,will,never,make,a,swordsman,[END]
had,i,been,born,a,peasant,they,might,have,left,me,out,to,die,or,sold,me,to,some,slaver,s,grotesquerie,[END]
alas,i,was,born,a,lannister,of,casterly,rock,and,the,grotesqueries,are,all,the,poorer,[END]
things,are,expected,of,me,[END]
my,father,was,the,hand,of,the,king,for,twenty,years,[END]
my,brother,later,killed,that,very,same,king,as,it,turns,out,but,life,is,full,of,these,little,ironies,[END]
my,sister,married,the,new,king,and,my,repulsive,nephew,will,be,king,after,him,[END]
i,must,do,my,part,for,the,honor,of,my,house,wouldn,t,you,agree,[END]
yet,how,[END]
well,my,legs,may,be,too,small,for,my,body,but,my,head,is,too,large,although,i,prefer,to,think,it,is,just,large,enough,for,my,mind,[END]
i,have,a,realistic,grasp,of,my,own,strengths,and,weaknesses,[END]
my,mind,is,my,weapon,[END]
my,brother,has,his,sword,king,robert,has,his,warhammer,and,i,have,my,mind,and,a,mind,needs,books,as,a,sword,needs,a,whetstone,if,it,is,to,keep,its,edge,tyrion,tapped,the,leather,cover,of,the,book,[END]
that,s,why,i,read,so,much,jon,snow,[END]
the,boy,absorbed,that,all,in,silence,[END]
he,had,the,stark,face,if,not,the,name,long,solemn,guarded,a,face,that,gave,nothing,away,[END]
whoever,his,mother,had,been,she,had,left,little,of,herself,in,her,son,[END]
what,are,you,reading,about,he,asked,[END]
dragons,tyrion,told,him,[END]
what,good,is,that,[END]
there,are,no,more,dragons,the,boy,said,with,the,easy,certainty,of,youth,[END]
so,they,say,tyrion,replied,[END]
sad,isn,t,it,[END]
when,i,was,your,age,i,used,to,dream,of,having,a,dragon,of,my,own,[END]
you,did,the,boy,said,suspiciously,[END]
perhaps,he,thought,tyrion,was,making,fun,of,him,[END]
oh,yes,[END]
even,a,stunted,twisted,ugly,little,boy,can,look,down,over,the,world,when,he,s,seated,on,a,dragon,s,back,tyrion,pushed,the,bearskin,aside,and,climbed,to,his,feet,[END]
i,used,to,start,fires,in,the,bowels,of,casterly,rock,and,stare,at,the,flames,for,hours,pretending,they,were,dragonfire,[END]
sometimes,i,d,imagine,my,father,burning,[END]
at,other,times,my,sister,jon,snow,was,staring,at,him,a,look,equal,parts,horror,and,fascination,[END]
tyrion,guffawed,[END]
don,t,look,at,me,that,way,bastard,[END]
i,know,your,secret,[END]
you,ve,dreamt,the,same,kind,of,dreams,[END]
no,jon,snow,said,horrified,[END]
i,wouldn,t,[END]
no,[END]
never,tyrion,raised,an,eyebrow,[END]
well,no,doubt,the,starks,have,been,terribly,good,to,you,[END]
i,m,certain,lady,stark,treats,you,as,if,you,were,one,of,her,own,[END]
and,your,brother,robb,he,s,always,been,kind,and,why,not,[END]
he,gets,winterfell,and,you,get,the,wall,[END]
and,your,father,he,must,have,good,reasons,for,packing,you,off,to,the,night,s,watch,[END]
stop,it,jon,snow,said,his,face,dark,with,anger,[END]
the,night,s,watch,is,a,noble,calling,[END]
tyrion,laughed,[END]
you,re,too,smart,to,believe,that,[END]
the,night,s,watch,is,a,midden,heap,for,all,the,misfits,of,the,realm,[END]
i,ve,seen,you,looking,at,yoren,and,his,boys,[END]
those,are,your,new,brothers,jon,snow,how,do,you,like,them,[END]
sullen,peasants,debtors,poachers,rapers,thieves,and,bastards,like,you,all,wind,up,on,the,wall,watching,for,grumkins,and,snarks,and,all,the,other,monsters,your,wet,nurse,warned,you,about,[END]
the,good,part,is,there,are,no,grumkins,or,snarks,so,it,s,scarcely,dangerous,work,[END]
the,bad,part,is,you,freeze,your,balls,off,but,since,you,re,not,allowed,to,breed,anyway,i,don,t,suppose,that,matters,[END]
stop,it,the,boy,screamed,[END]
he,took,a,step,forward,his,hands,coiling,into,fists,close,to,tears,[END]
suddenly,absurdly,tyrion,felt,guilty,[END]
he,took,a,step,forward,intending,to,give,the,boy,a,reassuring,pat,on,the,shoulder,or,mutter,some,word,of,apology,[END]
he,never,saw,the,wolf,where,it,was,or,how,it,came,at,him,[END]
one,moment,he,was,walking,toward,snow,and,the,next,he,was,flat,on,his,back,on,the,hard,rocky,ground,the,book,spinning,away,from,him,as,he,fell,the,breath,going,out,of,him,at,the,sudden,impact,his,mouth,full,of,dirt,and,blood,and,rotting,leaves,[END]
as,he,tried,to,get,up,his,back,spasmed,painfully,[END]
he,must,have,wrenched,it,in,the,fall,[END]
he,ground,his,teeth,in,frustration,grabbed,a,root,and,pulled,himself,back,to,a,sitting,position,[END]
help,me,he,said,to,the,boy,reaching,up,a,hand,[END]
and,suddenly,the,wolf,was,between,them,[END]
he,did,not,growl,[END]
the,damned,thing,never,made,a,sound,[END]
he,only,looked,at,him,with,those,bright,red,eyes,and,showed,him,his,teeth,and,that,was,more,than,enough,[END]
tyrion,sagged,back,to,the,ground,with,a,grunt,[END]
don,t,help,me,then,[END]
i,ll,sit,right,here,until,you,leave,[END]
jon,snow,stroked,ghost,s,thick,white,fur,smiling,now,[END]
ask,me,nicely,[END]
tyrion,lannister,felt,the,anger,coiling,inside,him,and,crushed,it,out,with,a,will,[END]
it,was,not,the,first,time,in,his,life,he,had,been,humiliated,and,it,would,not,be,the,last,[END]
perhaps,he,even,deserved,this,[END]
i,should,be,very,grateful,for,your,kind,assistance,jon,he,said,mildly,[END]
down,ghost,the,boy,said,[END]
the,direwolf,sat,on,his,haunches,[END]
those,red,eyes,never,left,tyrion,[END]
jon,came,around,behind,him,slid,his,hands,under,his,arms,and,lifted,him,easily,to,his,feet,[END]
then,he,picked,up,the,book,and,handed,it,back,[END]
why,did,he,attack,me,tyrion,asked,with,a,sidelong,glance,at,the,direwolf,[END]
he,wiped,blood,and,dirt,from,his,mouth,with,the,back,of,his,hand,[END]
maybe,he,thought,you,were,a,grumkin,[END]
tyrion,glanced,at,him,sharply,[END]
then,he,laughed,a,raw,snort,of,amusement,that,came,bursting,out,through,his,nose,entirely,without,his,permission,[END]
oh,gods,he,said,choking,on,his,laughter,and,shaking,his,head,i,suppose,i,do,rather,look,like,a,grumkin,[END]
what,does,he,do,to,snarks,[END]
you,don,t,want,to,know,jon,picked,up,the,wineskin,and,handed,it,to,tyrion,[END]
tyrion,pulled,out,the,stopper,tilted,his,head,and,squeezed,a,long,stream,into,his,mouth,[END]
the,wine,was,cool,fire,as,it,trickled,down,his,throat,and,warmed,his,belly,[END]
he,held,out,the,skin,to,jon,snow,[END]
want,some,[END]
the,boy,took,the,skin,and,tried,a,cautious,swallow,[END]
it,s,true,isn,t,it,he,said,when,he,was,done,[END]
what,you,said,about,the,night,s,watch,[END]
tyrion,nodded,[END]
jon,snow,set,his,mouth,in,a,grim,line,[END]
if,that,s,what,it,is,that,s,what,it,is,[END]
tyrion,grinned,at,him,[END]
that,s,good,bastard,[END]
most,men,would,rather,deny,a,hard,truth,than,face,it,[END]
most,men,the,boy,said,[END]
but,not,you,[END]
no,tyrion,admitted,not,me,[END]
i,seldom,even,dream,of,dragons,anymore,[END]
there,are,no,dragons,he,scooped,up,the,fallen,bearskin,[END]
come,we,had,better,return,to,camp,before,your,uncle,calls,the,banners,[END]
the,walk,was,short,but,the,ground,was,rough,underfoot,and,his,legs,were,cramping,badly,by,the,time,they,got,back,[END]
jon,snow,offered,a,hand,to,help,him,over,a,thick,tangle,of,roots,but,tyrion,shook,him,off,[END]
he,would,make,his,own,way,as,he,had,all,his,life,[END]
still,the,camp,was,a,welcome,sight,[END]
the,shelters,had,been,thrown,up,against,the,tumbledown,wall,of,a,long-abandoned,holdfast,a,shield,against,the,wind,[END]
the,horses,had,been,fed,and,a,fire,had,been,laid,[END]

he,dragged,himself,over,to,where,his,man,morrec,was,tending,the,stewpot,[END]
wordlessly,morrec,handed,him,the,ladle,[END]
tyrion,tasted,and,handed,it,back,[END]

there,you,are,[END]

i,thought,the,others,had,gotten,you,[END]
it,was,the,grumkins,tyrion,told,him,laughing,[END]
jon,snow,smiled,[END]
stark,shot,a,baffled,look,at,yoren,[END]
the,old,man,grunted,shrugged,and,went,back,to,his,bloody,work,[END]
the,squirrel,gave,some,body,to,the,stew,and,they,ate,it,with,black,bread,and,hard,cheese,that,night,around,their,fire,[END]
tyrion,shared,around,his,skin,of,wine,until,even,yoren,grew,mellow,[END]
one,by,one,the,company,drifted,off,to,their,shelters,and,to,sleep,all,but,jon,snow,who,had,drawn,the,night,s,first,watch,[END]

as,he,stepped,into,the,shelter,his,men,had,built,for,him,he,paused,and,looked,back,at,jon,snow,[END]
the,boy,stood,near,the,fire,his,face,still,and,hard,looking,deep,into,the,flames,[END]
tyrion,lannister,smiled,sadly,and,went,to,bed,[END]
catelyn,[END]
ned,and,the,girls,were,eight,days,gone,when,maester,luwin,came,to,her,one,night,in,bran,s,sickroom,carrying,a,reading,lamp,and,the,books,of,account,[END]
it,is,past,time,that,we,reviewed,the,figures,my,lady,he,said,[END]

catelyn,looked,at,bran,in,his,sickbed,and,brushed,his,hair,back,off,his,forehead,[END]
it,had,grown,very,long,she,realized,[END]
she,would,have,to,cut,it,soon,[END]

poole,went,south,to,establish,lord,eddard,s,household,at,king,s,landing,[END]
catelyn,nodded,absently,[END]
oh,yes,[END]
i,remember,bran,looked,so,pale,[END]
she,wondered,whether,they,might,move,his,bed,under,the,window,so,he,could,get,the,morning,sun,[END]
maester,luwin,set,the,lamp,in,a,niche,by,the,door,and,fiddled,with,its,wick,[END]
there,are,several,appointments,that,require,your,immediate,attention,my,lady,[END]
besides,the,steward,we,need,a,captain,of,the,guards,to,fill,jory,s,place,a,new,master,of,horse,[END]

bran,s,robb,opened,the,window,and,let,the,night,air,into,the,stuffy,tower,room,[END]

if,you,swear,to,me,you,ll,sleep,robb,went,to,the,window,but,as,he,reached,for,the,shutters,another,sound,was,added,to,the,mournful,howling,of,the,direwolves,[END]
dogs,he,said,listening,[END]
all,the,dogs,are,barking,[END]
they,ve,never,done,that,before,catelyn,heard,his,breath,catch,in,his,throat,[END]
when,she,looked,up,his,face,was,pale,in,the,lamplight,[END]
fire,he,whispered,[END]
fire,she,thought,and,then,bran,[END]

help,me,with,bran,[END]
robb,did,not,seem,to,hear,her,[END]
the,library,tower,s,on,fire,he,said,[END]
catelyn,could,see,the,flickering,reddish,light,through,the,open,window,now,[END]
she,sagged,with,relief,[END]
bran,was,safe,[END]
the,library,was,across,the,bailey,there,was,no,way,the,fire,would,reach,them,here,[END]
thank,the,gods,she,whispered,[END]
robb,looked,at,her,as,if,she,d,gone,mad,[END]
mother,stay,here,[END]
i,ll,come,back,as,soon,as,the,fire,s,out,he,ran,then,[END]
she,heard,him,shout,to,the,guards,outside,the,room,heard,them,descending,together,in,a,wild,rush,taking,the,stairs,two,and,three,at,a,time,[END]
outside,there,were,shouts,of,fire,in,the,yard,screams,running,footsteps,the,whinny,of,frightened,horses,and,the,frantic,barking,of,the,castle,dogs,[END]
the,howling,was,gone,she,realized,as,she,listened,to,the,cacophony,[END]
the,direwolves,had,fallen,silent,[END]
catelyn,said,a,silent,prayer,of,thanks,to,the,seven,faces,of,god,as,she,went,to,the,window,[END]
across,the,bailey,long,tongues,of,flame,shot,from,the,windows,of,the,library,[END]
she,watched,the,smoke,rise,into,the,sky,and,thought,sadly,of,all,the,books,the,starks,had,gathered,over,the,centuries,[END]
then,she,closed,the,shutters,[END]
when,she,turned,away,from,the,window,the,man,was,in,the,room,with,her,[END]
you,weren,t,s,posed,to,be,here,he,muttered,sourly,[END]
no,one,was,s,posed,to,be,here,[END]
he,was,a,small,dirty,man,in,filthy,brown,clothing,and,he,stank,of,horses,[END]
catelyn,knew,all,the,men,who,worked,in,their,stables,and,he,was,none,of,them,[END]
he,was,gaunt,with,limp,blond,hair,and,pale,eyes,deep-sunk,in,a,bony,face,and,there,was,a,dagger,in,his,hand,[END]
catelyn,looked,at,the,knife,then,at,bran,[END]
no,she,said,[END]
the,word,stuck,in,her,throat,the,merest,whisper,[END]
he,must,have,heard,her,[END]
it,s,a,mercy,he,said,[END]
he,s,dead,already,[END]
no,catelyn,said,louder,now,as,she,found,her,voice,again,[END]
no,you,can,t,she,spun,back,toward,the,window,to,scream,for,help,but,the,man,moved,faster,than,she,would,have,believed,[END]
one,hand,clamped,down,over,her,mouth,and,yanked,back,her,head,the,other,brought,the,dagger,up,to,her,windpipe,[END]
the,stench,of,him,was,overwhelming,[END]
she,reached,up,with,both,hands,and,grabbed,the,blade,with,all,her,strength,pulling,it,away,from,her,throat,[END]
she,heard,him,cursing,into,her,ear,[END]
her,fingers,were,slippery,with,blood,but,she,would,not,let,go,of,the,dagger,[END]
the,hand,over,her,mouth,clenched,more,tightly,shutting,off,her,air,[END]
catelyn,twisted,her,head,to,the,side,and,managed,to,get,a,piece,of,his,flesh,between,her,teeth,[END]
she,bit,down,hard,into,his,palm,[END]
the,man,grunted,in,pain,[END]
she,ground,her,teeth,together,and,tore,at,him,and,all,of,a,sudden,he,let,go,[END]
the,taste,of,his,blood,filled,her,mouth,[END]
she,sucked,in,air,and,screamed,and,he,grabbed,her,hair,and,pulled,her,away,from,him,and,she,stumbled,and,went,down,and,then,he,was,standing,over,her,breathing,hard,shaking,[END]
the,dagger,was,still,clutched,tightly,in,his,right,hand,slick,with,blood,[END]
you,weren,t,s,posed,to,be,here,he,repeated,stupidly,[END]
catelyn,saw,the,shadow,slip,through,the,open,door,behind,him,[END]
there,was,a,low,rumble,less,than,a,snarl,the,merest,whisper,of,a,threat,but,he,must,have,heard,something,because,he,started,to,turn,just,as,the,wolf,made,its,leap,[END]
they,went,down,together,half,sprawled,over,catelyn,where,she,d,fallen,[END]
the,wolf,had,him,under,the,jaw,[END]
the,man,s,shriek,lasted,less,than,a,second,before,the,beast,wrenched,back,its,head,taking,out,half,his,throat,[END]
his,blood,felt,like,warm,rain,as,it,sprayed,across,her,face,[END]
the,wolf,was,looking,at,her,[END]
its,jaws,were,red,and,wet,and,its,eyes,glowed,golden,in,the,dark,room,[END]
it,was,bran,s,wolf,she,realized,[END]
of,course,it,was,[END]
thank,you,catelyn,whispered,her,voice,faint,and,tiny,[END]
she,lifted,her,hand,trembling,[END]
the,wolf,padded,closer,sniffed,at,her,fingers,then,licked,at,the,blood,with,a,wet,rough,tongue,[END]
when,it,had,cleaned,all,the,blood,off,her,hand,it,turned,away,silently,and,jumped,up,on,bran,s,bed,and,lay,down,beside,him,[END]
catelyn,began,to,laugh,hysterically,[END]
that,was,the,way,they,found,them,when,robb,and,maester,luwin,and,ser,rodrik,burst,in,with,half,the,guards,in,winterfell,[END]
when,the,laughter,finally,died,in,her,throat,they,wrapped,her,in,warm,blankets,and,led,her,back,to,the,great,keep,to,her,own,chambers,[END]
old,nan,undressed,her,and,helped,her,into,a,scalding,hot,bath,and,washed,the,blood,off,her,with,a,soft,cloth,[END]
afterward,maester,luwin,arrived,to,dress,her,wounds,[END]
the,cuts,in,her,fingers,went,deep,almost,to,the,bone,and,her,scalp,was,raw,and,bleeding,where,he,d,pulled,out,a,handful,of,hair,[END]
the,maester,told,her,the,pain,was,just,starting,now,and,gave,her,milk,of,the,poppy,to,help,her,sleep,[END]
finally,she,closed,her,eyes,[END]
when,she,opened,them,again,they,told,her,that,she,had,slept,four,days,[END]
catelyn,nodded,and,sat,up,in,bed,[END]
it,all,seemed,like,a,nightmare,to,her,now,everything,since,bran,s,fall,a,terrible,dream,of,blood,and,grief,but,she,had,the,pain,in,her,hands,to,remind,her,that,it,was,real,[END]
she,felt,weak,and,light-headed,yet,strangely,resolute,as,if,a,great,weight,had,lifted,from,her,[END]
bring,me,some,bread,and,honey,she,told,her,servants,and,take,word,to,maester,luwin,that,my,bandages,want,changing,they,looked,at,her,in,surprise,and,ran,to,do,her,bidding,[END]
catelyn,remembered,the,way,she,had,been,before,and,she,was,ashamed,[END]
she,had,let,them,all,down,her,children,her,husband,her,house,[END]
it,would,not,happen,again,[END]
she,would,show,these,northerners,how,strong,a,tully,of,riverrun,could,be,[END]
robb,arrived,before,her,food,[END]
rodrik,cassel,came,with,him,and,her,husband,s,ward,theon,greyjoy,and,lastly,hallis,mollen,a,muscular,guardsman,with,a,square,brown,beard,[END]
he,was,the,new,captain,of,the,guard,robb,said,[END]
her,son,was,dressed,in,boiled,leather,and,ringmail,she,saw,and,a,sword,hung,at,his,waist,[END]
who,was,he,catelyn,asked,them,[END]
no,one,knows,his,name,hallis,mollen,told,her,[END]
he,was,no,man,of,winterfell,m,lady,but,some,says,they,seen,him,here,and,about,the,castle,these,past,few,weeks,[END]
one,of,the,king,s,men,then,she,said,or,one,of,the,lannisters,[END]
he,could,have,waited,behind,when,the,others,left,[END]
maybe,hal,said,[END]
with,all,these,strangers,filling,up,winterfell,of,late,there,s,no,way,of,saying,who,he,belonged,to,[END]
he,d,been,hiding,in,your,stables,greyjoy,said,[END]
you,could,smell,it,on,him,[END]
and,how,could,he,go,unnoticed,she,said,sharply,[END]
hallis,mollen,looked,abashed,[END]
between,the,horses,lord,eddard,took,south,and,them,we,sent,north,to,the,night,s,watch,the,stalls,were,half-empty,[END]
it,were,no,great,trick,to,hide,from,the,stableboys,[END]
could,be,hodor,saw,him,the,talk,is,that,boy,s,been,acting,queer,but,simple,as,he,is,hal,shook,his,head,[END]
we,found,where,he,d,been,sleeping,robb,put,in,[END]
he,had,ninety,silver,stags,in,a,leather,bag,buried,beneath,the,straw,[END]
it,s,good,to,know,my,son,s,life,was,not,sold,cheaply,catelyn,said,bitterly,[END]
hallis,mollen,looked,at,her,confused,[END]
begging,your,grace,m,lady,you,saying,he,was,out,to,kill,your,boy,[END]
greyjoy,was,doubtful,[END]
that,s,madness,[END]
he,came,for,bran,catelyn,said,[END]
he,kept,muttering,how,i,wasn,t,supposed,to,be,there,[END]
he,set,the,library,fire,thinking,i,would,rush,to,put,it,out,taking,any,guards,with,me,[END]
if,i,hadn,t,been,half-mad,with,grief,it,would,have,worked,[END]
why,would,anyone,want,to,kill,bran,robb,said,[END]
gods,he,s,only,a,little,boy,helpless,sleeping,[END]
catelyn,gave,her,firstborn,a,challenging,look,[END]
if,you,are,to,rule,in,the,north,you,must,think,these,things,through,robb,[END]
answer,your,own,question,[END]
why,would,anyone,want,to,kill,a,sleeping,child,[END]
before,he,could,answer,the,servants,returned,with,a,plate,of,food,fresh,from,the,kitchen,[END]
there,was,much,more,than,she,d,asked,for,hot,bread,butter,and,honey,and,blackberry,preserves,a,rasher,of,bacon,and,a,soft-boiled,egg,a,wedge,of,cheese,a,pot,of,mint,tea,[END]
and,with,it,came,maester,luwin,[END]
how,is,my,son,maester,catelyn,looked,at,all,the,food,and,found,she,had,no,appetite,[END]
maester,luwin,lowered,his,eyes,[END]
unchanged,my,lady,[END]
it,was,the,reply,she,had,expected,no,more,and,no,less,[END]
her,hands,throbbed,with,pain,as,if,the,blade,were,still,in,her,cutting,deep,[END]
she,sent,the,servants,away,and,looked,back,to,robb,[END]
do,you,have,the,answer,yet,[END]
someone,is,afraid,bran,might,wake,up,robb,said,afraid,of,what,he,might,say,or,do,afraid,of,something,he,knows,[END]
catelyn,was,proud,of,him,[END]
very,good,she,turned,to,the,new,captain,of,the,guard,[END]
we,must,keep,bran,safe,[END]
if,there,was,one,killer,there,could,be,others,[END]
how,many,guards,do,you,want,m,lady,hal,asked,[END]
so,long,as,lord,eddard,is,away,my,son,is,the,master,of,winterfell,she,told,him,[END]

no,one,sees,bran,without,my,warrant,or,my,mother,s,[END]

the,circumstances,did,not,allow,me,to,examine,it,closely,but,i,can,vouch,for,its,edge,catelyn,replied,with,a,dry,smile,[END]
why,do,you,ask,[END]
we,found,the,knife,still,in,the,villain,s,grasp,[END]
it,seemed,to,me,that,it,was,altogether,too,fine,a,weapon,for,such,a,man,so,i,looked,at,it,long,and,hard,[END]
the,blade,is,valyrian,steel,the,hilt,dragonbone,[END]
a,weapon,like,that,has,no,business,being,in,the,hands,of,such,as,him,[END]

i,do,not,think,bran,fell,from,that,tower,she,said,into,the,stillness,[END]
i,think,he,was,thrown,[END]
the,shock,was,plain,on,their,faces,[END]
my,lady,that,is,a,monstrous,suggestion,said,rodrik,cassel,[END]
even,the,kingslayer,would,flinch,at,the,murder,of,an,innocent,child,[END]

septa,mordane,sniffed,in,disapproval,[END]
a,noble,lady,does,not,feed,dogs,at,her,table,she,said,breaking,off,another,piece,of,comb,and,letting,the,honey,drip,down,onto,her,bread,[END]

and,where,is,arya,this,morning,[END]
she,wasn,t,hungry,sansa,said,knowing,full,well,that,her,sister,had,probably,stolen,down,to,the,kitchen,hours,ago,and,wheedled,a,breakfast,out,of,some,cook,s,boy,[END]
do,remind,her,to,dress,nicely,today,[END]
the,grey,velvet,perhaps,[END]
we,are,all,invited,to,ride,with,the,queen,and,princess,myrcella,in,the,royal,wheelhouse,and,we,must,look,our,best,[END]
sansa,already,looked,her,best,[END]
she,had,brushed,out,her,long,auburn,hair,until,it,shone,and,picked,her,nicest,blue,silks,[END]
she,had,been,looking,forward,to,today,for,more,than,a,week,[END]
it,was,a,great,honor,to,ride,with,the,queen,and,besides,prince,joffrey,might,be,there,[END]
her,betrothed,[END]
just,thinking,it,made,her,feel,a,strange,fluttering,inside,even,though,they,were,not,to,marry,for,years,and,years,[END]
sansa,did,not,really,know,joffrey,yet,but,she,was,already,in,love,with,him,[END]
he,was,all,she,ever,dreamt,her,prince,should,be,tall,and,handsome,and,strong,with,hair,like,gold,[END]
she,treasured,every,chance,to,spend,time,with,him,few,as,they,were,[END]
the,only,thing,that,scared,her,about,today,was,arya,[END]
arya,had,a,way,of,ruining,everything,[END]
you,never,knew,what,she,would,do,[END]
i,ll,tell,her,sansa,said,uncertainly,but,she,ll,dress,the,way,she,always,does,she,hoped,it,wouldn,t,be,too,embarrassing,[END]
may,i,be,excused,[END]
you,may,septa,mordane,helped,herself,to,more,bread,and,honey,and,sansa,slid,from,the,bench,[END]
lady,followed,at,her,heels,as,she,ran,from,the,inn,s,common,room,[END]
outside,she,stood,for,a,moment,amidst,the,shouts,and,curses,and,the,creak,of,wooden,wheels,as,the,men,broke,down,the,tents,and,pavilions,and,loaded,the,wagons,for,another,day,s,march,[END]
the,inn,was,a,sprawling,three-story,structure,of,pale,stone,the,biggest,that,sansa,had,ever,seen,but,even,so,it,had,accommodations,for,less,than,a,third,of,the,king,s,party,which,had,swollen,to,more,than,four,hundred,with,the,addition,of,her,father,s,household,and,the,freeriders,who,had,joined,them,on,the,road,[END]
she,found,arya,on,the,banks,of,the,trident,trying,to,hold,nymeria,still,while,she,brushed,dried,mud,from,her,fur,[END]
the,direwolf,was,not,enjoying,the,process,[END]
arya,was,wearing,the,same,riding,leathers,she,had,worn,yesterday,and,the,day,before,[END]
you,better,put,on,something,pretty,sansa,told,her,[END]
septa,mordane,said,so,[END]
we,re,traveling,in,the,queen,s,wheelhouse,with,princess,myrcella,today,[END]
i,m,not,arya,said,trying,to,brush,a,tangle,out,of,nymeria,s,matted,grey,fur,[END]
mycah,and,i,are,going,to,ride,upstream,and,look,for,rubies,at,the,ford,[END]
rubies,sansa,said,lost,[END]
what,rubies,[END]
arya,gave,her,a,look,like,she,was,so,stupid,[END]
rhaegar,s,rubies,[END]
this,is,where,king,robert,killed,him,and,won,the,crown,[END]
sansa,regarded,her,scrawny,little,sister,in,disbelief,[END]
you,can,t,look,for,rubies,the,princess,is,expecting,us,[END]
the,queen,invited,us,both,[END]
i,don,t,care,arya,said,[END]
the,wheelhouse,doesn,t,even,have,windows,you,can,t,see,a,thing,[END]
what,could,you,want,to,see,sansa,said,annoyed,[END]
she,had,been,thrilled,by,the,invitation,and,her,stupid,sister,was,going,to,ruin,everything,just,as,she,d,feared,[END]
it,s,all,just,fields,and,farms,and,holdfasts,[END]
it,is,not,arya,said,stubbornly,[END]
if,you,came,with,us,sometimes,you,d,see,[END]
i,hate,riding,sansa,said,fervently,[END]
all,it,does,is,get,you,soiled,and,dusty,and,sore,[END]
arya,shrugged,[END]
hold,still,she,snapped,at,nymeria,i,m,not,hurting,you,then,to,sansa,she,said,when,we,were,crossing,the,neck,i,counted,thirty-six,flowers,i,never,saw,before,and,mycah,showed,me,a,lizard-lion,[END]
sansa,shuddered,[END]
they,had,been,twelve,days,crossing,the,neck,rumbling,down,a,crooked,causeway,through,an,endless,black,bog,and,she,had,hated,every,moment,of,it,[END]
the,air,had,been,damp,and,clammy,the,causeway,so,narrow,they,could,not,even,make,proper,camp,at,night,they,had,to,stop,right,on,the,kingsroad,[END]
dense,thickets,of,half-drowned,trees,pressed,close,around,them,branches,dripping,with,curtains,of,pale,fungus,[END]
huge,flowers,bloomed,in,the,mud,and,floated,on,pools,of,stagnant,water,but,if,you,were,stupid,enough,to,leave,the,causeway,to,pluck,them,there,were,quicksands,waiting,to,suck,you,down,and,snakes,watching,from,the,trees,and,lizard-lions,floating,half-submerged,in,the,water,like,black,logs,with,eyes,and,teeth,[END]
none,of,which,stopped,arya,of,course,[END]
one,day,she,came,back,grinning,her,horsey,grin,her,hair,all,tangled,and,her,clothes,covered,in,mud,clutching,a,raggedy,bunch,of,purple,and,green,flowers,for,father,[END]
sansa,kept,hoping,he,would,tell,arya,to,behave,herself,and,act,like,the,highborn,lady,she,was,supposed,to,be,but,he,never,did,he,only,hugged,her,and,thanked,her,for,the,flowers,[END]
that,just,made,her,worse,[END]
then,it,turned,out,the,purple,flowers,were,called,poison,kisses,and,arya,got,a,rash,on,her,arms,[END]
sansa,would,have,thought,that,might,have,taught,her,a,lesson,but,arya,laughed,about,it,and,the,next,day,she,rubbed,mud,all,over,her,arms,like,some,ignorant,bog,woman,just,because,her,friend,mycah,told,her,it,would,stop,the,itching,[END]
she,had,bruises,on,her,arms,and,shoulders,too,dark,purple,welts,and,faded,green-and-yellow,splotches,sansa,had,seen,them,when,her,sister,undressed,for,sleep,[END]
how,she,had,gotten,those,only,the,seven,gods,knew,[END]
arya,was,still,going,on,brushing,out,nymeria,s,tangles,and,chattering,about,things,she,d,seen,on,the,trek,south,[END]
last,week,we,found,this,haunted,watchtower,and,the,day,before,we,chased,a,herd,of,wild,horses,[END]
you,should,have,seen,them,run,when,they,caught,a,scent,of,nymeria,the,wolf,wriggled,in,her,grasp,and,arya,scolded,her,[END]
stop,that,i,have,to,do,the,other,side,you,re,all,muddy,[END]
you,re,not,supposed,to,leave,the,column,sansa,reminded,her,[END]
father,said,so,[END]
arya,shrugged,[END]
i,didn,t,go,far,[END]
anyway,nymeria,was,with,me,the,whole,time,[END]
i,don,t,always,go,off,either,[END]
sometimes,it,s,fun,just,to,ride,along,with,the,wagons,and,talk,to,people,[END]
sansa,knew,all,about,the,sorts,of,people,arya,liked,to,talk,to,squires,and,grooms,and,serving,girls,old,men,and,naked,children,rough-spoken,freeriders,of,uncertain,birth,[END]
arya,would,make,friends,with,anybody,[END]
this,mycah,was,the,worst,a,butcher,s,boy,thirteen,and,wild,he,slept,in,the,meat,wagon,and,smelled,of,the,slaughtering,block,[END]
just,the,sight,of,him,was,enough,to,make,sansa,feel,sick,but,arya,seemed,to,prefer,his,company,to,hers,[END]
sansa,was,running,out,of,patience,now,[END]
you,have,to,come,with,me,she,told,her,sister,firmly,[END]
you,can,t,refuse,the,queen,[END]
septa,mordane,will,expect,you,[END]
arya,ignored,her,[END]
she,gave,a,hard,yank,with,the,brush,[END]
nymeria,growled,and,spun,away,affronted,[END]
come,back,here,[END]
there,s,going,to,be,lemon,cakes,and,tea,sansa,went,on,all,adult,and,reasonable,[END]
lady,brushed,against,her,leg,[END]
sansa,scratched,her,ears,the,way,she,liked,and,lady,sat,beside,her,on,her,haunches,watching,arya,chase,nymeria,[END]
why,would,you,want,to,ride,a,smelly,old,horse,and,get,all,sore,and,sweaty,when,you,could,recline,on,feather,pillows,and,eat,cakes,with,the,queen,[END]
i,don,t,like,the,queen,arya,said,casually,[END]
sansa,sucked,in,her,breath,shocked,that,even,arya,would,say,such,a,thing,but,her,sister,prattled,on,heedless,[END]
she,won,t,even,let,me,bring,nymeria,she,thrust,the,brush,under,her,belt,and,stalked,her,wolf,[END]
nymeria,watched,her,approach,warily,[END]
a,royal,wheelhouse,is,no,place,for,a,wolf,sansa,said,[END]
and,princess,myrcella,is,afraid,of,them,you,know,that,[END]
myrcella,is,a,little,baby,arya,grabbed,nymeria,around,her,neck,but,the,moment,she,pulled,out,the,brush,again,the,direwolf,wriggled,free,and,bounded,off,[END]
frustrated,arya,threw,down,the,brush,[END]
bad,wolf,she,shouted,[END]
sansa,couldn,t,help,but,smile,a,little,[END]
the,kennelmaster,once,told,her,that,an,animal,takes,after,its,master,[END]
she,gave,lady,a,quick,little,hug,[END]
lady,licked,her,cheek,[END]
sansa,giggled,[END]
arya,heard,and,whirled,around,glaring,[END]
i,don,t,care,what,you,say,i,m,going,out,riding,her,long,horsey,face,got,the,stubborn,look,that,meant,she,was,going,to,do,something,willful,[END]
gods,be,true,arya,sometimes,you,act,like,such,a,child,sansa,said,[END]
i,ll,go,by,myself,then,[END]
it,will,be,ever,so,much,nicer,that,way,[END]
lady,and,i,will,eat,all,the,lemon,cakes,and,just,have,the,best,time,without,you,[END]
she,turned,to,walk,off,but,arya,shouted,after,her,they,won,t,let,you,bring,lady,either,she,was,gone,before,sansa,could,think,of,a,reply,chasing,nymeria,along,the,river,[END]
alone,and,humiliated,sansa,took,the,long,way,back,to,the,inn,where,she,knew,septa,mordane,would,be,waiting,[END]
lady,padded,quietly,by,her,side,[END]
she,was,almost,in,tears,[END]
all,she,wanted,was,for,things,to,be,nice,and,pretty,the,way,they,were,in,the,songs,[END]
why,couldn,t,arya,be,sweet,and,delicate,and,kind,like,princess,myrcella,[END]
she,would,have,liked,a,sister,like,that,[END]
sansa,could,never,understand,how,two,sisters,born,only,two,years,apart,could,be,so,different,[END]
it,would,have,been,easier,if,arya,had,been,a,bastard,like,their,half,brother,jon,[END]
she,even,looked,like,jon,with,the,long,face,and,brown,hair,of,the,starks,and,nothing,of,their,lady,mother,in,her,face,or,her,coloring,[END]
and,jon,s,mother,had,been,common,or,so,people,whispered,[END]
once,when,she,was,littler,sansa,had,even,asked,mother,if,perhaps,there,hadn,t,been,some,mistake,[END]
perhaps,the,grumkins,had,stolen,her,real,sister,[END]
but,mother,had,only,laughed,and,said,no,arya,was,her,daughter,and,sansa,s,trueborn,sister,blood,of,their,blood,[END]
sansa,could,not,think,why,mother,would,want,to,lie,about,it,so,she,supposed,it,had,to,be,true,[END]
as,she,neared,the,center,of,camp,her,distress,was,quickly,forgotten,[END]
a,crowd,had,gathered,around,the,queen,s,wheelhouse,[END]
sansa,heard,excited,voices,buzzing,like,a,hive,of,bees,[END]
the,doors,had,been,thrown,open,she,saw,and,the,queen,stood,at,the,top,of,the,wooden,steps,smiling,down,at,someone,[END]
she,heard,her,saying,the,council,does,us,great,honor,my,good,lords,[END]
what,s,happening,she,asked,a,squire,she,knew,[END]
the,council,sent,riders,from,king,s,landing,to,escort,us,the,rest,of,the,way,he,told,her,[END]
an,honor,guard,for,the,king,[END]
anxious,to,see,sansa,let,lady,clear,a,path,through,the,crowd,[END]
people,moved,aside,hastily,for,the,direwolf,[END]
when,she,got,closer,she,saw,two,knights,kneeling,before,the,queen,in,armor,so,fine,and,gorgeous,that,it,made,her,blink,[END]
one,knight,wore,an,intricate,suit,of,white,enameled,scales,brilliant,as,a,field,of,new-fallen,snow,with,silver,chasings,and,clasps,that,glittered,in,the,sun,[END]
when,he,removed,his,helm,sansa,saw,that,he,was,an,old,man,with,hair,as,pale,as,his,armor,yet,he,seemed,strong,and,graceful,for,all,that,[END]
from,his,shoulders,hung,the,pure,white,cloak,of,the,kingsguard,[END]
his,companion,was,a,man,near,twenty,whose,armor,was,steel,plate,of,a,deep,forest-green,[END]
he,was,the,handsomest,man,sansa,had,ever,set,eyes,upon,tall,and,powerfully,made,with,jet-black,hair,that,fell,to,his,shoulders,and,framed,a,clean-shaven,face,and,laughing,green,eyes,to,match,his,armor,[END]
cradled,under,one,arm,was,an,antlered,helm,its,magnificent,rack,shimmering,in,gold,[END]
at,first,sansa,did,not,notice,the,third,stranger,[END]
he,did,not,kneel,with,the,others,[END]
he,stood,to,one,side,beside,their,horses,a,gaunt,grim,man,who,watched,the,proceedings,in,silence,[END]
his,face,was,pockmarked,and,beardless,with,deepset,eyes,and,hollow,cheeks,[END]
though,he,was,not,an,old,man,only,a,few,wisps,of,hair,remained,to,him,sprouting,above,his,ears,but,those,he,had,grown,long,as,a,woman,s,[END]
his,armor,was,iron-grey,chainmail,over,layers,of,boiled,leather,plain,and,unadorned,and,it,spoke,of,age,and,hard,use,[END]
above,his,right,shoulder,the,stained,leather,hilt,of,the,blade,strapped,to,his,back,was,visible,a,two-handed,greatsword,too,long,to,be,worn,at,his,side,[END]
the,king,is,gone,hunting,but,i,know,he,will,be,pleased,to,see,you,when,he,returns,the,queen,was,saying,to,the,two,knights,who,knelt,before,her,but,sansa,could,not,take,her,eyes,off,the,third,man,[END]
he,seemed,to,feel,the,weight,of,her,gaze,[END]
slowly,he,turned,his,head,[END]
lady,growled,[END]
a,terror,as,overwhelming,as,anything,sansa,stark,had,ever,felt,filled,her,suddenly,[END]
she,stepped,backward,and,bumped,into,someone,[END]
strong,hands,grasped,her,by,the,shoulders,and,for,a,moment,sansa,thought,it,was,her,father,but,when,she,turned,it,was,the,burned,face,of,sandor,clegane,looking,down,at,her,his,mouth,twisted,in,a,terrible,mockery,of,a,smile,[END]
you,are,shaking,girl,he,said,his,voice,rasping,[END]
do,i,frighten,you,so,much,[END]
he,did,and,had,since,she,had,first,laid,eyes,on,the,ruin,that,fire,had,made,of,his,face,though,it,seemed,to,her,now,that,he,was,not,half,so,terrifying,as,the,other,[END]
still,sansa,wrenched,away,from,him,and,the,hound,laughed,and,lady,moved,between,them,rumbling,a,warning,[END]
sansa,dropped,to,her,knees,to,wrap,her,arms,around,the,wolf,[END]
they,were,all,gathered,around,gaping,she,could,feel,their,eyes,on,her,and,here,and,there,she,heard,muttered,comments,and,titters,of,laughter,[END]
a,wolf,a,man,said,and,someone,else,said,seven,hells,that,s,a,direwolf,and,the,first,man,said,what,s,it,doing,in,camp,and,the,hound,s,rasping,voice,replied,the,starks,use,them,for,wet,nurses,and,sansa,realized,that,the,two,stranger,knights,were,looking,down,on,her,and,lady,swords,in,their,hands,and,then,she,was,frightened,again,and,ashamed,[END]
tears,filled,her,eyes,[END]
she,heard,the,queen,say,joffrey,go,to,her,[END]
and,her,prince,was,there,[END]
leave,her,alone,joffrey,said,[END]
he,stood,over,her,beautiful,in,blue,wool,and,black,leather,his,golden,curls,shining,in,the,sun,like,a,crown,[END]
he,gave,her,his,hand,drew,her,to,her,feet,[END]
what,is,it,sweet,lady,[END]
why,are,you,afraid,[END]
no,one,will,hurt,you,[END]
put,away,your,swords,all,of,you,[END]

the,hound,ever,faithful,bowed,and,slid,away,quietly,through,the,press,[END]
sansa,struggled,to,steady,herself,[END]
she,felt,like,such,a,fool,[END]
she,was,a,stark,of,winterfell,a,noble,lady,and,someday,she,would,be,a,queen,[END]
it,was,not,him,my,sweet,prince,she,tried,to,explain,[END]
it,was,the,other,one,[END]
the,two,stranger,knights,exchanged,a,look,[END]
payne,chuckled,the,young,man,in,the,green,armor,[END]
the,older,man,in,white,spoke,to,sansa,gently,[END]
ofttimes,ser,ilyn,frightens,me,as,well,sweet,lady,[END]
he,has,a,fearsome,aspect,[END]
as,well,he,should,the,queen,had,descended,from,the,wheelhouse,[END]
the,spectators,parted,to,make,way,for,her,[END]
if,the,wicked,do,not,fear,the,king,s,justice,you,have,put,the,wrong,man,in,the,office,[END]
sansa,finally,found,her,words,[END]
then,surely,you,have,chosen,the,right,one,your,grace,she,said,and,a,gale,of,laughter,erupted,all,around,her,[END]

beneath,the,linen,bandages,her,fingers,still,throbbed,where,the,dagger,had,bitten,[END]
the,pain,was,her,scourge,catelyn,felt,lest,she,forget,[END]
she,could,not,bend,the,last,two,fingers,on,her,left,hand,and,the,others,would,never,again,be,dexterous,[END]
yet,that,was,a,small,enough,price,to,pay,for,bran,s,life,[END]
ser,rodrik,chose,that,moment,to,appear,on,deck,[END]
my,good,friend,said,moreo,through,his,forked,green,beard,[END]
the,tyroshi,loved,bright,colors,even,in,their,facial,hair,[END]
it,is,so,fine,to,see,you,looking,better,[END]
yes,ser,rodrik,agreed,[END]
i,haven,t,wanted,to,die,for,almost,two,days,now,he,bowed,to,catelyn,[END]
my,lady,[END]
he,was,looking,better,[END]
a,shade,thinner,than,he,had,been,when,they,set,out,from,white,harbor,but,almost,himself,again,[END]
the,strong,winds,in,the,bite,and,the,roughness,of,the,narrow,sea,had,not,agreed,with,him,and,he,d,almost,gone,over,the,side,when,the,storm,seized,them,unexpectedly,off,dragonstone,yet,somehow,he,had,clung,to,a,rope,until,three,of,moreo,s,men,could,rescue,him,and,carry,him,safely,below,decks,[END]
the,captain,was,just,telling,me,that,our,voyage,is,almost,at,an,end,she,said,[END]
ser,rodrik,managed,a,wry,smile,[END]
so,soon,he,looked,odd,without,his,great,white,side,whiskers,smaller,somehow,less,fierce,and,ten,years,older,[END]
yet,back,on,the,bite,it,had,seemed,prudent,to,submit,to,a,crewman,s,razor,after,his,whiskers,had,become,hopelessly,befouled,for,the,third,time,while,he,leaned,over,the,rail,and,retched,into,the,swirling,winds,[END]
i,will,leave,you,to,discuss,your,business,captain,moreo,said,[END]
he,bowed,and,took,his,leave,of,them,[END]
the,galley,skimmed,the,water,like,a,dragonfly,her,oars,rising,and,falling,in,perfect,time,[END]
ser,rodrik,held,the,rail,and,looked,out,over,the,passing,shore,[END]
i,have,not,been,the,most,valiant,of,protectors,[END]
catelyn,touched,his,arm,[END]
we,are,here,ser,rodrik,and,safely,[END]
that,is,all,that,truly,matters,her,hand,groped,beneath,her,cloak,her,fingers,stiff,and,fumbling,[END]
the,dagger,was,still,at,her,side,[END]
she,found,she,had,to,touch,it,now,and,then,to,reassure,herself,[END]
now,we,must,reach,the,king,s,master-at-arms,and,pray,that,he,can,be,trusted,[END]
ser,aron,santagar,is,a,vain,man,but,an,honest,one,ser,rodrik,s,hand,went,to,his,face,to,stroke,his,whiskers,and,discovered,once,again,that,they,were,gone,[END]
he,looked,nonplussed,[END]
he,may,know,the,blade,yes,but,my,lady,the,moment,we,go,ashore,we,are,at,risk,[END]
and,there,are,those,at,court,who,will,know,you,on,sight,[END]
catelyn,s,mouth,grew,tight,[END]
littlefinger,she,murmured,[END]
his,face,swam,up,before,her,a,boy,s,face,though,he,was,a,boy,no,longer,[END]
his,father,had,died,several,years,before,so,he,was,lord,baelish,now,yet,still,they,called,him,littlefinger,[END]
her,brother,edmure,had,given,him,that,name,long,ago,at,riverrun,[END]
his,family,s,modest,holdings,were,on,the,smallest,of,the,fingers,and,petyr,had,been,slight,and,short,for,his,age,[END]
ser,rodrik,cleared,his,throat,[END]
lord,baelish,once,ah,his,thought,trailed,off,uncertainly,in,search,of,the,polite,word,[END]
catelyn,was,past,delicacy,[END]
he,was,my,father,s,ward,[END]
we,grew,up,together,in,riverrun,[END]
i,thought,of,him,as,a,brother,but,his,feelings,for,me,were,more,than,brotherly,[END]
when,it,was,announced,that,i,was,to,wed,brandon,stark,petyr,challenged,for,the,right,to,my,hand,[END]
it,was,madness,[END]
brandon,was,twenty,petyr,scarcely,fifteen,[END]
i,had,to,beg,brandon,to,spare,petyr,s,life,[END]
he,let,him,off,with,a,scar,[END]
afterward,my,father,sent,him,away,[END]
i,have,not,seen,him,since,she,lifted,her,face,to,the,spray,as,if,the,brisk,wind,could,blow,the,memories,away,[END]
he,wrote,to,me,at,riverrun,after,brandon,was,killed,but,i,burned,the,letter,unread,[END]
by,then,i,knew,that,ned,would,marry,me,in,his,brother,s,place,[END]
ser,rodrik,s,fingers,fumbled,once,again,for,nonexistent,whiskers,[END]
littlefinger,sits,on,the,small,council,now,[END]
i,knew,he,would,rise,high,catelyn,said,[END]
he,was,always,clever,even,as,a,boy,but,it,is,one,thing,to,be,clever,and,another,to,be,wise,[END]
i,wonder,what,the,years,have,done,to,him,[END]
high,overhead,the,far-eyes,sang,out,from,the,rigging,[END]
captain,moreo,came,scrambling,across,the,deck,giving,orders,and,all,around,them,the,storm,dancer,burst,into,frenetic,activity,as,king,s,landing,slid,into,view,atop,its,three,high,hills,[END]
three,hundred,years,ago,catelyn,knew,those,heights,had,been,covered,with,forest,and,only,a,handful,of,fisherfolk,had,lived,on,the,north,shore,of,the,blackwater,rush,where,that,deep,swift,river,flowed,into,the,sea,[END]
then,aegon,the,conqueror,had,sailed,from,dragonstone,[END]
it,was,here,that,his,army,had,put,ashore,and,there,on,the,highest,hill,that,he,built,his,first,crude,redoubt,of,wood,and,earth,[END]
now,the,city,covered,the,shore,as,far,as,catelyn,could,see,manses,and,arbors,and,granaries,brick,storehouses,and,timbered,inns,and,merchant,s,stalls,taverns,and,graveyards,and,brothels,all,piled,one,on,another,[END]
she,could,hear,the,clamor,of,the,fish,market,even,at,this,distance,[END]
between,the,buildings,were,broad,roads,lined,with,trees,wandering,crookback,streets,and,alleys,so,narrow,that,two,men,could,not,walk,abreast,[END]
visenya,s,hill,was,crowned,by,the,great,sept,of,baelor,with,its,seven,crystal,towers,[END]
across,the,city,on,the,hill,of,rhaenys,stood,the,blackened,walls,of,the,dragonpit,its,huge,dome,collapsing,into,ruin,its,bronze,doors,closed,now,for,a,century,[END]
the,street,of,the,sisters,ran,between,them,straight,as,an,arrow,[END]
the,city,walls,rose,in,the,distance,high,and,strong,[END]
a,hundred,quays,lined,the,waterfront,and,the,harbor,was,crowded,with,ships,[END]
deepwater,fishing,boats,and,river,runners,came,and,went,ferrymen,poled,back,and,forth,across,the,blackwater,rush,trading,galleys,unloaded,goods,from,braavos,and,pentos,and,lys,[END]
catelyn,spied,the,queen,s,ornate,barge,tied,up,beside,a,fat-bellied,whaler,from,the,port,of,ibben,its,hull,black,with,tar,while,upriver,a,dozen,lean,golden,warships,rested,in,their,cribs,sails,furled,and,cruel,iron,rams,lapping,at,the,water,[END]
and,above,it,all,frowning,down,from,aegon,s,high,hill,was,the,red,keep,seven,huge,drum-towers,crowned,with,iron,ramparts,an,immense,grim,barbican,vaulted,halls,and,covered,bridges,barracks,and,dungeons,and,granaries,massive,curtain,walls,studded,with,archers,nests,all,fashioned,of,pale,red,stone,[END]
aegon,the,conqueror,had,commanded,it,built,[END]
his,son,maegor,the,cruel,had,seen,it,completed,[END]
afterward,he,had,taken,the,heads,of,every,stonemason,woodworker,and,builder,who,had,labored,on,it,[END]
only,the,blood,of,the,dragon,would,ever,know,the,secrets,of,the,fortress,the,dragonlords,had,built,he,vowed,[END]
yet,now,the,banners,that,flew,from,its,battlements,were,golden,not,black,and,where,the,three-headed,dragon,had,once,breathed,fire,now,pranced,the,crowned,stag,of,house,baratheon,[END]
a,high-masted,swan,ship,from,the,summer,isles,was,beating,out,from,port,its,white,sails,huge,with,wind,[END]
the,storm,dancer,moved,past,it,pulling,steadily,for,shore,[END]
my,lady,ser,rodrik,said,i,have,thought,on,how,best,to,proceed,while,i,lay,abed,[END]
you,must,not,enter,the,castle,[END]
i,will,go,in,your,stead,and,bring,ser,aron,to,you,in,some,safe,place,[END]
she,studied,the,old,knight,as,the,galley,drew,near,to,a,pier,[END]
moreo,was,shouting,in,the,vulgar,valyrian,of,the,free,cities,[END]
you,would,be,as,much,at,risk,as,i,would,[END]
ser,rodrik,smiled,[END]
i,think,not,[END]
i,looked,at,my,reflection,in,the,water,earlier,and,scarcely,recognized,myself,[END]
my,mother,was,the,last,person,to,see,me,without,whiskers,and,she,is,forty,years,dead,[END]
i,believe,i,am,safe,enough,my,lady,[END]
moreo,bellowed,a,command,[END]
as,one,sixty,oars,lifted,from,the,river,then,reversed,and,backed,water,[END]
the,galley,slowed,[END]
another,shout,[END]
the,oars,slid,back,inside,the,hull,[END]
as,they,thumped,against,the,dock,tyroshi,seamen,leapt,down,to,tie,up,[END]
moreo,came,bustling,up,all,smiles,[END]
king,s,landing,my,lady,as,you,did,command,and,never,has,a,ship,made,a,swifter,or,surer,passage,[END]
will,you,be,needing,assistance,to,carry,your,things,to,the,castle,[END]
we,shall,not,be,going,to,the,castle,[END]
perhaps,you,can,suggest,an,inn,someplace,clean,and,comfortable,and,not,too,far,from,the,river,[END]
the,tyroshi,fingered,his,forked,green,beard,[END]
just,so,[END]
i,know,of,several,establishments,that,might,suit,your,needs,[END]
yet,first,if,i,may,be,so,bold,there,is,the,matter,of,the,second,half,of,the,payment,we,agreed,upon,[END]
and,of,course,the,extra,silver,you,were,so,kind,as,to,promise,[END]
sixty,stags,i,believe,it,was,[END]
for,the,oarmen,catelyn,reminded,him,[END]
oh,of,a,certainty,said,moreo,[END]
though,perhaps,i,should,hold,it,for,them,until,we,return,to,tyrosh,[END]
for,the,sake,of,their,wives,and,children,[END]
if,you,give,them,the,silver,here,my,lady,they,will,dice,it,away,or,spend,it,all,for,a,night,s,pleasure,[END]
there,are,worse,things,to,spend,money,on,ser,rodrik,put,in,[END]
winter,is,coming,[END]
a,man,must,make,his,own,choices,catelyn,said,[END]
they,earned,the,silver,[END]
how,they,spend,it,is,no,concern,of,mine,[END]
as,you,say,my,lady,moreo,replied,bowing,and,smiling,[END]
just,to,be,sure,catelyn,paid,the,oarmen,herself,a,stag,to,each,man,and,a,copper,to,the,two,men,who,carried,their,chests,halfway,up,visenya,s,hill,to,the,inn,that,moreo,had,suggested,[END]
it,was,a,rambling,old,place,on,eel,alley,[END]
the,woman,who,owned,it,was,a,sour,crone,with,a,wandering,eye,who,looked,them,over,suspiciously,and,bit,the,coin,that,catelyn,offered,her,to,make,sure,it,was,real,[END]
her,rooms,were,large,and,airy,though,and,moreo,swore,that,her,fish,stew,was,the,most,savory,in,all,the,seven,kingdoms,[END]
best,of,all,she,had,no,interest,in,their,names,[END]
i,think,it,best,if,you,stay,away,from,the,common,room,ser,rodrik,said,after,they,had,settled,in,[END]
even,in,a,place,like,this,one,never,knows,who,may,be,watching,he,wore,ringmail,dagger,and,longsword,under,a,dark,cloak,with,a,hood,he,could,pull,up,over,his,head,[END]
i,will,be,back,before,nightfall,with,ser,aron,he,promised,[END]
rest,now,my,lady,[END]
catelyn,was,tired,[END]
the,voyage,had,been,long,and,fatiguing,and,she,was,no,longer,as,young,as,she,had,been,[END]
her,windows,opened,on,the,alley,and,rooftops,with,a,view,of,the,blackwater,beyond,[END]
she,watched,ser,rodrik,set,off,striding,briskly,through,the,busy,streets,until,he,was,lost,in,the,crowds,then,decided,to,take,his,advice,[END]
the,bedding,was,stuffed,with,straw,instead,of,feathers,but,she,had,no,trouble,falling,asleep,[END]
she,woke,to,a,pounding,on,her,door,[END]
catelyn,sat,up,sharply,[END]
outside,the,window,the,rooftops,of,king,s,landing,were,red,in,the,light,of,the,setting,sun,[END]
she,had,slept,longer,than,she,intended,[END]
a,fist,hammered,at,her,door,again,and,a,voice,called,out,open,in,the,name,of,the,king,[END]
a,moment,she,called,out,[END]
she,wrapped,herself,in,her,cloak,[END]
the,dagger,was,on,the,bedside,table,[END]
she,snatched,it,up,before,she,unlatched,the,heavy,wooden,door,[END]
the,men,who,pushed,into,the,room,wore,the,black,ringmail,and,golden,cloaks,of,the,city,watch,[END]
their,leader,smiled,at,the,dagger,in,her,hand,and,said,no,need,for,that,m,lady,[END]
we,re,to,escort,you,to,the,castle,[END]
by,whose,authority,she,said,[END]
he,showed,her,a,ribbon,[END]
catelyn,felt,her,breath,catch,in,her,throat,[END]
the,seal,was,a,mockingbird,in,grey,wax,[END]
petyr,she,said,[END]
so,soon,[END]
something,must,have,happened,to,ser,rodrik,[END]
she,looked,at,the,head,guardsman,[END]
do,you,know,who,i,am,[END]
no,m,lady,he,said,[END]
m,lord,littlefinger,said,only,to,bring,you,to,him,and,see,that,you,were,not,mistreated,[END]
catelyn,nodded,[END]
you,may,wait,outside,while,i,dress,[END]
she,bathed,her,hands,in,the,basin,and,wrapped,them,in,clean,linen,[END]
her,fingers,were,thick,and,awkward,as,she,struggled,to,lace,up,her,bodice,and,knot,a,drab,brown,cloak,about,her,neck,[END]
how,could,littlefinger,have,known,she,was,here,[END]
ser,rodrik,would,never,have,told,him,[END]
old,he,might,be,but,he,was,stubborn,and,loyal,to,a,fault,[END]
were,they,too,late,had,the,lannisters,reached,king,s,landing,before,her,[END]
no,if,that,were,true,ned,would,be,here,too,and,surely,he,would,have,come,to,her,[END]
how,[END]
then,she,thought,moreo,[END]
the,tyroshi,knew,who,they,were,and,where,they,were,damn,him,[END]
she,hoped,he,d,gotten,a,good,price,for,the,information,[END]
they,had,brought,a,horse,for,her,[END]
the,lamps,were,being,lit,along,the,streets,as,they,set,out,and,catelyn,felt,the,eyes,of,the,city,on,her,as,she,rode,surrounded,by,the,guard,in,their,golden,cloaks,[END]
when,they,reached,the,red,keep,the,portcullis,was,down,and,the,great,gates,sealed,for,the,night,but,the,castle,windows,were,alive,with,flickering,lights,[END]
the,guardsmen,left,their,mounts,outside,the,walls,and,escorted,her,through,a,narrow,postern,door,then,up,endless,steps,to,a,tower,[END]
he,was,alone,in,the,room,seated,at,a,heavy,wooden,table,an,oil,lamp,beside,him,as,he,wrote,[END]
when,they,ushered,her,inside,he,set,down,his,pen,and,looked,at,her,[END]
cat,he,said,quietly,[END]
why,have,i,been,brought,here,in,this,fashion,[END]
he,rose,and,gestured,brusquely,to,the,guards,[END]

i,am,not,accustomed,to,being,summoned,like,a,serving,wench,she,said,icily,[END]
as,a,boy,you,still,knew,the,meaning,of,courtesy,[END]
i,ve,angered,you,my,lady,[END]
that,was,never,my,intent,he,looked,contrite,[END]
the,look,brought,back,vivid,memories,for,catelyn,[END]
he,had,been,a,sly,child,but,after,his,mischiefs,he,always,looked,contrite,it,was,a,gift,he,had,[END]
the,years,had,not,changed,him,much,[END]
petyr,had,been,a,small,boy,and,he,had,grown,into,a,small,man,an,inch,or,two,shorter,than,catelyn,slender,and,quick,with,the,sharp,features,she,remembered,and,the,same,laughing,grey-green,eyes,[END]
he,had,a,little,pointed,chin,beard,now,and,threads,of,silver,in,his,dark,hair,though,he,was,still,shy,of,thirty,[END]
they,went,well,with,the,silver,mockingbird,that,fastened,his,cloak,[END]
even,as,a,child,he,had,always,loved,his,silver,[END]
how,did,you,know,i,was,in,the,city,she,asked,him,[END]

their,fathers,were,farmers,and,wagonmen,and,poachers,smiths,and,miners,and,oars,on,a,trading,galley,[END]

that,or,sleep,with,a,dagger,by,your,bed,[END]

by,the,time,jon,left,the,armory,it,was,almost,midday,[END]
the,sun,had,broken,through,the,clouds,[END]
he,turned,his,back,on,it,and,lifted,his,eyes,to,the,wall,blazing,blue,and,crystalline,in,the,sunlight,[END]
even,after,all,these,weeks,the,sight,of,it,still,gave,him,the,shivers,[END]
centuries,of,windblown,dirt,had,pocked,and,scoured,it,covering,it,like,a,film,and,it,often,seemed,a,pale,grey,the,color,of,an,overcast,sky,but,when,the,sun,caught,it,fair,on,a,bright,day,it,shone,alive,with,light,a,colossal,blue-white,cliff,that,filled,up,half,the,sky,[END]
the,largest,structure,ever,built,by,the,hands,of,man,benjen,stark,had,told,jon,on,the,kingsroad,when,they,had,first,caught,sight,of,the,wall,in,the,distance,[END]
and,beyond,a,doubt,the,most,useless,tyrion,lannister,had,added,with,a,grin,but,even,the,imp,grew,silent,as,they,rode,closer,[END]
you,could,see,it,from,miles,off,a,pale,blue,line,across,the,northern,horizon,stretching,away,to,the,east,and,west,and,vanishing,in,the,far,distance,immense,and,unbroken,[END]
this,is,the,end,of,the,world,it,seemed,to,say,[END]
when,they,finally,spied,castle,black,its,timbered,keeps,and,stone,towers,looked,like,nothing,more,than,a,handful,of,toy,blocks,scattered,on,the,snow,beneath,the,vast,wall,of,ice,[END]
the,ancient,stronghold,of,the,black,brothers,was,no,winterfell,no,true,castle,at,all,[END]
lacking,walls,it,could,not,be,defended,not,from,the,south,or,east,or,west,but,it,was,only,the,north,that,concerned,the,night,s,watch,and,to,the,north,loomed,the,wall,[END]
almost,seven,hundred,feet,high,it,stood,three,times,the,height,of,the,tallest,tower,in,the,stronghold,it,sheltered,[END]
his,uncle,said,the,top,was,wide,enough,for,a,dozen,armored,knights,to,ride,abreast,[END]
the,gaunt,outlines,of,huge,catapults,and,monstrous,wooden,cranes,stood,sentry,up,there,like,the,skeletons,of,great,birds,and,among,them,walked,men,in,black,as,small,as,ants,[END]

sometimes,he,could,almost,forget,that,it,was,there,the,way,you,forgot,about,the,sky,or,the,earth,underfoot,but,there,were,other,times,when,it,seemed,as,if,there,was,nothing,else,in,the,world,[END]
it,was,older,than,the,seven,kingdoms,and,when,he,stood,beneath,it,and,looked,up,it,made,jon,dizzy,[END]

you,won,t,learn,anything,from,me,jon,told,him,[END]
he,had,seen,little,of,the,dwarf,since,their,journey,ended,[END]
as,the,queen,s,own,brother,tyrion,lannister,had,been,an,honored,guest,of,the,night,s,watch,[END]
the,lord,commander,had,given,him,rooms,in,the,king,s,tower,so-called,though,no,king,had,visited,it,for,a,hundred,years,and,lannister,dined,at,mormont,s,own,table,and,spent,his,days,riding,the,wall,and,his,nights,dicing,and,drinking,with,ser,alliser,and,bowen,marsh,and,the,other,high,officers,[END]
oh,i,learn,things,everywhere,i,go,the,little,man,gestured,up,at,the,wall,with,a,gnarled,black,walking,stick,[END]
as,i,was,saying,why,is,it,that,when,one,man,builds,a,wall,the,next,man,immediately,needs,to,know,what,s,on,the,other,side,he,cocked,his,head,and,looked,at,jon,with,his,curious,mismatched,eyes,[END]
you,do,want,to,know,what,s,on,the,other,side,don,t,you,[END]
it,s,nothing,special,jon,said,[END]
he,wanted,to,ride,with,benjen,stark,on,his,rangings,deep,into,the,mysteries,of,the,haunted,forest,wanted,to,fight,mance,rayder,s,wildlings,and,ward,the,realm,against,the,others,but,it,was,better,not,to,speak,of,the,things,you,wanted,[END]
the,rangers,say,it,s,just,woods,and,mountains,and,frozen,lakes,with,lots,of,snow,and,ice,[END]

the,dwarf,lifted,an,eyebrow,[END]

long,enough,for,tyrion,to,begin,to,wonder,why,he,was,doing,this,[END]
he,had,just,about,decided,to,forget,his,sudden,whim,and,go,to,bed,when,the,cage,gave,a,jerk,and,began,to,ascend,[END]
he,moved,upward,slowly,by,fits,and,starts,at,first,then,more,smoothly,[END]
the,ground,fell,away,beneath,him,the,cage,swung,and,tyrion,wrapped,his,hands,around,the,iron,bars,[END]
he,could,feel,the,cold,of,the,metal,even,through,his,gloves,[END]
morrec,had,a,fire,burning,in,his,room,he,noted,with,approval,but,the,lord,commander,s,tower,was,dark,[END]
the,old,bear,had,more,sense,than,he,did,it,seemed,[END]
then,he,was,above,the,towers,still,inching,his,way,upward,[END]
castle,black,lay,below,him,etched,in,moonlight,[END]
you,could,see,how,stark,and,empty,it,was,from,up,here,windowless,keeps,crumbling,walls,courtyards,choked,with,broken,stone,[END]
farther,off,he,could,see,the,lights,of,mole,s,town,the,little,village,half,a,league,south,along,the,kingsroad,and,here,and,there,the,bright,glitter,of,moonlight,on,water,where,icy,streams,descended,from,the,mountain,heights,to,cut,across,the,plains,[END]
the,rest,of,the,world,was,a,bleak,emptiness,of,windswept,hills,and,rocky,fields,spotted,with,snow,[END]
finally,a,thick,voice,behind,him,said,seven,hells,it,s,the,dwarf,and,the,cage,jerked,to,a,sudden,stop,and,hung,there,swinging,slowly,back,and,forth,the,ropes,creaking,[END]
bring,him,in,damn,it,there,was,a,grunt,and,a,loud,groaning,of,wood,as,the,cage,slid,sideways,and,then,the,wall,was,beneath,him,[END]
tyrion,waited,until,the,swinging,had,stopped,before,he,pushed,open,the,cage,door,and,hopped,down,onto,the,ice,[END]
a,heavy,figure,in,black,was,leaning,on,the,winch,while,a,second,held,the,cage,with,a,gloved,hand,[END]
their,faces,were,muffled,in,woolen,scarves,so,only,their,eyes,showed,and,they,were,plump,with,layers,of,wool,and,leather,black,on,black,[END]
and,what,will,you,be,wanting,this,time,of,night,the,one,by,the,winch,asked,[END]
a,last,look,[END]
the,men,exchanged,sour,glances,[END]
look,all,you,want,the,other,one,said,[END]
just,have,a,care,you,don,t,fall,off,little,man,[END]
the,old,bear,would,have,our,hides,a,small,wooden,shack,stood,under,the,great,crane,and,tyrion,saw,the,dull,glow,of,a,brazier,and,felt,a,brief,gust,of,warmth,when,the,winch,men,opened,the,door,and,went,back,inside,[END]
and,then,he,was,alone,[END]
it,was,bitingly,cold,up,here,and,the,wind,pulled,at,his,clothes,like,an,insistent,lover,[END]
the,top,of,the,wall,was,wider,than,the,kingsroad,often,was,so,tyrion,had,no,fear,of,falling,although,the,footing,was,slicker,than,he,would,have,liked,[END]
the,brothers,spread,crushed,stone,across,the,walkways,but,the,weight,of,countless,footsteps,would,melt,the,wall,beneath,so,the,ice,would,seem,to,grow,around,the,gravel,swallowing,it,until,the,path,was,bare,again,and,it,was,time,to,crush,more,stone,[END]
still,it,was,nothing,that,tyrion,could,not,manage,[END]
he,looked,off,to,the,east,and,west,at,the,wall,stretching,before,him,a,vast,white,road,with,no,beginning,and,no,end,and,a,dark,abyss,on,either,side,[END]
west,he,decided,for,no,special,reason,and,he,began,to,walk,that,way,following,the,pathway,nearest,the,north,edge,where,the,gravel,looked,freshest,[END]
his,bare,cheeks,were,ruddy,with,the,cold,and,his,legs,complained,more,loudly,with,every,step,but,tyrion,ignored,them,[END]
the,wind,swirled,around,him,gravel,crunched,beneath,his,boots,while,ahead,the,white,ribbon,followed,the,lines,of,the,hills,rising,higher,and,higher,until,it,was,lost,beyond,the,western,horizon,[END]
he,passed,a,massive,catapult,as,tall,as,a,city,wall,its,base,sunk,deep,into,the,wall,[END]
the,throwing,arm,had,been,taken,off,for,repairs,and,then,forgotten,it,lay,there,like,a,broken,toy,half-embedded,in,the,ice,[END]
on,the,far,side,of,the,catapult,a,muffled,voice,called,out,a,challenge,[END]
who,goes,there,[END]

tyrion,stopped,[END]
if,i,halt,too,long,i,ll,freeze,in,place,jon,he,said,as,a,shaggy,pale,shape,slid,toward,him,silently,and,sniffed,at,his,furs,[END]
hello,ghost,[END]
jon,snow,moved,closer,[END]
he,looked,bigger,and,heavier,in,his,layers,of,fur,and,leather,the,hood,of,his,cloak,pulled,down,over,his,face,[END]

this,is,the,last,place,i,would,have,expected,to,see,you,he,carried,a,heavy,spear,tipped,in,iron,taller,than,he,was,and,a,sword,hung,at,his,side,in,a,leather,sheath,[END]

tyrion,scratched,the,white,wolf,behind,the,ears,[END]
the,red,eyes,watched,him,impassively,[END]
the,beast,came,up,as,high,as,his,chest,now,[END]
another,year,and,tyrion,had,the,gloomy,feeling,he,d,be,looking,up,at,him,[END]

beyond,him,the,wall,fell,away,sharply,beyond,him,there,was,only,the,darkness,and,the,wild,[END]
tyrion,followed,him,and,side,by,side,they,stood,upon,the,edge,of,the,world,[END]
the,night,s,watch,permitted,the,forest,to,come,no,closer,than,half,a,mile,of,the,north,face,of,the,wall,[END]
the,thickets,of,ironwood,and,sentinel,and,oak,that,had,once,grown,there,had,been,harvested,centuries,ago,to,create,a,broad,swath,of,open,ground,through,which,no,enemy,could,hope,to,pass,unseen,[END]
tyrion,had,heard,that,elsewhere,along,the,wall,between,the,three,fortresses,the,wildwood,had,come,creeping,back,over,the,decades,that,there,were,places,where,grey-green,sentinels,and,pale,white,weirwoods,had,taken,root,in,the,shadow,of,the,wall,itself,but,castle,black,had,a,prodigious,appetite,for,firewood,and,here,the,forest,was,still,kept,at,bay,by,the,axes,of,the,black,brothers,[END]
it,was,never,far,though,[END]
from,up,here,tyrion,could,see,it,the,dark,trees,looming,beyond,the,stretch,of,open,ground,like,a,second,wall,built,parallel,to,the,first,a,wall,of,night,[END]
few,axes,had,ever,swung,in,that,black,wood,where,even,the,moonlight,could,not,penetrate,the,ancient,tangle,of,root,and,thorn,and,grasping,limb,[END]

his,jokes,of,grumkins,and,snarks,no,longer,seemed,quite,so,droll,[END]

when,she,slammed,that,door,and,dropped,the,heavy,crossbar,nobody,could,get,into,her,room,not,septa,mordane,or,fat,tom,or,sansa,or,jory,or,the,hound,nobody,[END]
she,slammed,it,now,[END]
when,the,bar,was,down,arya,finally,felt,safe,enough,to,cry,[END]
she,went,to,the,window,seat,and,sat,there,sniffling,hating,them,all,and,herself,most,of,all,[END]
it,was,all,her,fault,everything,bad,that,had,happened,[END]
sansa,said,so,and,jeyne,too,[END]

a,moment,later,she,heard,him,going,away,[END]
fat,tom,was,always,easy,to,fool,[END]
arya,went,to,the,chest,at,the,foot,of,her,bed,[END]
she,knelt,opened,the,lid,and,began,pulling,her,clothes,out,with,both,hands,grabbing,handfuls,of,silk,and,satin,and,velvet,and,wool,and,tossing,them,on,the,floor,[END]
it,was,there,at,the,bottom,of,the,chest,where,she,d,hidden,it,[END]
arya,lifted,it,out,almost,tenderly,and,drew,the,slender,blade,from,its,sheath,[END]

she,went,back,to,the,window,needle,in,hand,and,looked,down,into,the,courtyard,below,[END]
if,only,she,could,climb,like,bran,she,thought,she,would,go,out,the,window,and,down,the,tower,run,away,from,this,horrible,place,away,from,sansa,and,septa,mordane,and,prince,joffrey,from,all,of,them,[END]
steal,some,food,from,the,kitchens,take,needle,and,her,good,boots,and,a,warm,cloak,[END]
she,could,find,nymeria,in,the,wild,woods,below,the,trident,and,together,they,d,return,to,winterfell,or,run,to,jon,on,the,wall,[END]
she,found,herself,wishing,that,jon,was,here,with,her,now,[END]
then,maybe,she,wouldn,t,feel,so,alone,[END]
a,soft,knock,at,the,door,behind,her,turned,arya,away,from,the,window,and,her,dreams,of,escape,[END]
arya,her,father,s,voice,called,out,[END]

only,she,kept,following,and,finally,we,had,to,throw,rocks,[END]
i,hit,her,twice,[END]
she,whined,and,looked,at,me,and,i,felt,so,shamed,but,it,was,right,wasn,t,it,[END]
the,queen,would,have,killed,her,[END]
it,was,right,her,father,said,[END]
and,even,the,lie,was,not,without,honor,he,d,put,needle,aside,when,he,went,to,arya,to,embrace,her,[END]
now,he,took,the,blade,up,again,and,walked,to,the,window,where,he,stood,for,a,moment,looking,out,across,the,courtyard,[END]

you,know,our,words,[END]
winter,is,coming,arya,whispered,[END]
the,hard,cruel,times,her,father,said,[END]

the,direwolf,she,said,thinking,of,nymeria,[END]
she,hugged,her,knees,against,her,chest,suddenly,afraid,[END]
let,me,tell,you,something,about,wolves,child,[END]
when,the,snows,fall,and,the,white,winds,blow,the,lone,wolf,dies,but,the,pack,survives,[END]
summer,is,the,time,for,squabbles,[END]
in,winter,we,must,protect,one,another,keep,each,other,warm,share,our,strengths,[END]
so,if,you,must,hate,arya,hate,those,who,would,truly,do,us,harm,[END]
septa,mordane,is,a,good,woman,and,sansa,sansa,is,your,sister,[END]
you,may,be,as,different,as,the,sun,and,the,moon,but,the,same,blood,flows,through,both,your,hearts,[END]
you,need,her,as,she,needs,you,and,i,need,both,of,you,gods,help,me,[END]
he,sounded,so,tired,that,it,made,arya,sad,[END]

i,can,be,as,strong,as,robb,[END]
he,held,needle,out,to,her,hilt,first,[END]

she,looked,at,the,sword,with,wonder,in,her,eyes,[END]
for,a,moment,she,was,afraid,to,touch,it,afraid,that,if,she,reached,for,it,it,would,be,snatched,away,again,but,then,her,father,said,go,on,it,s,yours,and,she,took,it,in,her,hand,[END]

the,next,morning,as,they,broke,their,fast,she,apologized,to,septa,mordane,and,asked,for,her,pardon,[END]
the,septa,peered,at,her,suspiciously,but,father,nodded,[END]
three,days,later,at,midday,her,father,s,steward,vayon,poole,sent,arya,to,the,small,hall,[END]
the,trestle,tables,had,been,dismantled,and,the,benches,shoved,against,the,walls,[END]
the,hall,seemed,empty,until,an,unfamiliar,voice,said,you,are,late,boy,a,slight,man,with,a,bald,head,and,a,great,beak,of,a,nose,stepped,out,of,the,shadows,holding,a,pair,of,slender,wooden,swords,[END]

arya,picked,it,up,and,clutched,it,nervously,with,both,hands,holding,it,out,in,front,of,her,[END]
it,was,heavier,than,it,looked,much,heavier,than,needle,[END]
the,bald,man,clicked,his,teeth,together,[END]
that,is,not,the,way,boy,[END]
this,is,not,a,greatsword,that,is,needing,two,hands,to,swing,it,[END]
you,will,take,the,blade,in,one,hand,[END]
it,s,too,heavy,arya,said,[END]

arya,took,her,right,hand,off,the,grip,and,wiped,her,sweaty,palm,on,her,pants,[END]
she,held,the,sword,in,her,left,hand,[END]
he,seemed,to,approve,[END]
the,left,is,good,[END]

now,you,will,try,to,strike,me,[END]
arya,tried,to,strike,him,[END]
she,tried,for,four,hours,until,every,muscle,in,her,body,was,sore,and,aching,while,syrio,forel,clicked,his,teeth,together,and,told,her,what,to,do,[END]
the,next,day,their,real,work,began,[END]
daenerys,[END]
the,dothraki,sea,ser,jorah,mormont,said,as,he,reined,to,a,halt,beside,her,on,the,top,of,the,ridge,[END]
beneath,them,the,plain,stretched,out,immense,and,empty,a,vast,flat,expanse,that,reached,to,the,distant,horizon,and,beyond,[END]
it,was,a,sea,dany,thought,[END]
past,here,there,were,no,hills,no,mountains,no,trees,nor,cities,nor,roads,only,the,endless,grasses,the,tall,blades,rippling,like,waves,when,the,winds,blew,[END]

it,murders,all,other,grass,and,glows,in,the,dark,with,the,spirits,of,the,damned,[END]
the,dothraki,claim,that,someday,ghost,grass,will,cover,the,entire,world,and,then,all,life,will,end,[END]

it,s,so,beautiful,here,i,don,t,want,to,think,about,everything,dying,[END]
as,you,will,khaleesi,ser,jorah,said,respectfully,[END]
she,heard,the,sound,of,voices,and,turned,to,look,behind,her,[END]
she,and,mormont,had,outdistanced,the,rest,of,their,party,and,now,the,others,were,climbing,the,ridge,below,them,[END]
her,handmaid,irri,and,the,young,archers,of,her,khas,were,fluid,as,centaurs,but,viserys,still,struggled,with,the,short,stirrups,and,the,flat,saddle,[END]
her,brother,was,miserable,out,here,[END]
he,ought,never,have,come,[END]
magister,illyrio,had,urged,him,to,wait,in,pentos,had,offered,him,the,hospitality,of,his,manse,but,viserys,would,have,none,of,it,[END]
he,would,stay,with,drogo,until,the,debt,had,been,paid,until,he,had,the,crown,he,had,been,promised,[END]
and,if,he,tries,to,cheat,me,he,will,learn,to,his,sorrow,what,it,means,to,wake,the,dragon,viserys,had,vowed,laying,a,hand,on,his,borrowed,sword,[END]
illyrio,had,blinked,at,that,and,wished,him,good,fortune,[END]
dany,realized,that,she,did,not,want,to,listen,to,any,of,her,brother,s,complaints,right,now,[END]
the,day,was,too,perfect,[END]
the,sky,was,a,deep,blue,and,high,above,them,a,hunting,hawk,circled,[END]
the,grass,sea,swayed,and,sighed,with,each,breath,of,wind,the,air,was,warm,on,her,face,and,dany,felt,at,peace,[END]

he,had,a,neck,and,shoulders,like,a,bull,and,coarse,black,hair,covered,his,arms,and,chest,so,thickly,that,there,was,none,left,for,his,head,[END]
yet,his,smiles,gave,dany,comfort,[END]
you,are,learning,to,talk,like,a,queen,daenerys,[END]

dany,had,no,place,in,these,parts,of,his,life,[END]
she,was,left,to,sup,alone,or,with,ser,jorah,and,her,brother,and,afterward,to,cry,herself,to,sleep,[END]
yet,every,night,some,time,before,the,dawn,drogo,would,come,to,her,tent,and,wake,her,in,the,dark,to,ride,her,as,relentlessly,as,he,rode,his,stallion,[END]
he,always,took,her,from,behind,dothraki,fashion,for,which,dany,was,grateful,that,way,her,lord,husband,could,not,see,the,tears,that,wet,her,face,and,she,could,use,her,pillow,to,muffle,her,cries,of,pain,[END]
when,he,was,done,he,would,close,his,eyes,and,begin,to,snore,softly,and,dany,would,lie,beside,him,her,body,bruised,and,sore,hurting,too,much,for,sleep,[END]
day,followed,day,and,night,followed,night,until,dany,knew,she,could,not,endure,a,moment,longer,[END]
she,would,kill,herself,rather,than,go,on,she,decided,one,night,[END]
yet,when,she,slept,that,night,she,dreamt,the,dragon,dream,again,[END]
viserys,was,not,in,it,this,time,[END]
there,was,only,her,and,the,dragon,[END]
its,scales,were,black,as,night,wet,and,slick,with,blood,[END]
her,blood,dany,sensed,[END]
its,eyes,were,pools,of,molten,magma,and,when,it,opened,its,mouth,the,flame,came,roaring,out,in,a,hot,jet,[END]
she,could,hear,it,singing,to,her,[END]
she,opened,her,arms,to,the,fire,embraced,it,let,it,swallow,her,whole,let,it,cleanse,her,and,temper,her,and,scour,her,clean,[END]
she,could,feel,her,flesh,sear,and,blacken,and,slough,away,could,feel,her,blood,boil,and,turn,to,steam,and,yet,there,was,no,pain,[END]
she,felt,strong,and,new,and,fierce,[END]
and,the,next,day,strangely,she,did,not,seem,to,hurt,quite,so,much,[END]
it,was,as,if,the,gods,had,heard,her,and,taken,pity,[END]
even,her,handmaids,noticed,the,change,[END]
khaleesi,jhiqui,said,what,is,wrong,[END]
are,you,sick,[END]

black-and-scarlet,she,thought,like,the,dragon,in,my,dream,[END]
the,stone,felt,strangely,warm,beneath,her,fingers,or,was,she,still,dreaming,[END]

from,that,hour,onward,each,day,was,easier,than,the,one,before,it,[END]
her,legs,grew,stronger,her,blisters,burst,and,her,hands,grew,callused,her,soft,thighs,toughened,supple,as,leather,[END]
the,khal,had,commanded,the,handmaid,irri,to,teach,dany,to,ride,in,the,dothraki,fashion,but,it,was,the,filly,who,was,her,real,teacher,[END]
the,horse,seemed,to,know,her,moods,as,if,they,shared,a,single,mind,[END]
with,every,passing,day,dany,felt,surer,in,her,seat,[END]
the,dothraki,were,a,hard,and,unsentimental,people,and,it,was,not,their,custom,to,name,their,animals,so,dany,thought,of,her,only,as,the,silver,[END]
she,had,never,loved,anything,so,much,[END]
as,the,riding,became,less,an,ordeal,dany,began,to,notice,the,beauties,of,the,land,around,her,[END]
she,rode,at,the,head,of,the,khalasar,with,drogo,and,his,bloodriders,so,she,came,to,each,country,fresh,and,unspoiled,[END]
behind,them,the,great,horde,might,tear,the,earth,and,muddy,the,rivers,and,send,up,clouds,of,choking,dust,but,the,fields,ahead,of,them,were,always,green,and,verdant,[END]
they,crossed,the,rolling,hills,of,norvos,past,terraced,farms,and,small,villages,where,the,townsfolk,watched,anxiously,from,atop,white,stucco,walls,[END]
they,forded,three,wide,placid,rivers,and,a,fourth,that,was,swift,and,narrow,and,treacherous,camped,beside,a,high,blue,waterfall,skirted,the,tumbled,ruins,of,a,vast,dead,city,where,ghosts,were,said,to,moan,among,blackened,marble,columns,[END]
they,raced,down,valyrian,roads,a,thousand,years,old,and,straight,as,a,dothraki,arrow,[END]
for,half,a,moon,they,rode,through,the,forest,of,qohor,where,the,leaves,made,a,golden,canopy,high,above,them,and,the,trunks,of,the,trees,were,as,wide,as,city,gates,[END]
there,were,great,elk,in,that,wood,and,spotted,tigers,and,lemurs,with,silver,fur,and,huge,purple,eyes,but,all,fled,before,the,approach,of,the,khalasar,and,dany,got,no,glimpse,of,them,[END]
by,then,her,agony,was,a,fading,memory,[END]
she,still,ached,after,a,long,day,s,riding,yet,somehow,the,pain,had,a,sweetness,to,it,now,and,each,morning,she,came,willingly,to,her,saddle,eager,to,know,what,wonders,waited,for,her,in,the,lands,ahead,[END]
she,began,to,find,pleasure,even,in,her,nights,and,if,she,still,cried,out,when,drogo,took,her,it,was,not,always,in,pain,[END]
at,the,bottom,of,the,ridge,the,grasses,rose,around,her,tall,and,supple,[END]

dany,could,hear,him,on,the,top,of,the,ridge,his,voice,shrill,with,anger,as,he,shouted,at,ser,jorah,[END]

the,green,swallowed,her,up,[END]

at,night,he,closeted,himself,with,maester,luwin,talking,or,going,over,account,books,[END]

thousands,and,thousands,of,years,ago,a,winter,fell,that,was,cold,and,hard,and,endless,beyond,all,memory,of,man,[END]
there,came,a,night,that,lasted,a,generation,and,kings,shivered,and,died,in,their,castles,even,as,the,swineherds,in,their,hovels,[END]
women,smothered,their,children,rather,than,see,them,starve,and,cried,and,felt,their,tears,freeze,on,their,cheeks,her,voice,and,her,needles,fell,silent,and,she,glanced,up,at,bran,with,pale,filmy,eyes,and,asked,so,child,[END]

they,were,cold,things,dead,things,that,hated,iron,and,fire,and,the,touch,of,the,sun,and,every,creature,with,hot,blood,in,its,veins,[END]
they,swept,over,holdfasts,and,cities,and,kingdoms,felled,heroes,and,armies,by,the,score,riding,their,pale,dead,horses,and,leading,hosts,of,the,slain,[END]
all,the,swords,of,men,could,not,stay,their,advance,and,even,maidens,and,suckling,babes,found,no,pity,in,them,[END]

her,voice,had,dropped,very,low,almost,to,a,whisper,and,bran,found,himself,leaning,forward,to,listen,[END]
now,these,were,the,days,before,the,andals,came,and,long,before,the,women,fled,across,the,narrow,sea,from,the,cities,of,the,rhoyne,and,the,hundred,kingdoms,of,those,times,were,the,kingdoms,of,the,first,men,who,had,taken,these,lands,from,the,children,of,the,forest,[END]

so,as,cold,and,death,filled,the,earth,the,last,hero,determined,to,seek,out,the,children,in,the,hopes,that,their,ancient,magics,could,win,back,what,the,armies,of,men,had,lost,[END]
he,set,out,into,the,dead,lands,with,a,sword,a,horse,a,dog,and,a,dozen,companions,[END]
for,years,he,searched,until,he,despaired,of,ever,finding,the,children,of,the,forest,in,their,secret,cities,[END]
one,by,one,his,friends,died,and,his,horse,and,finally,even,his,dog,and,his,sword,froze,so,hard,the,blade,snapped,when,he,tried,to,use,it,[END]
and,the,others,smelled,the,hot,blood,in,him,and,came,silent,on,his,trail,stalking,him,with,packs,of,pale,white,spiders,big,as,hounds,[END]
the,door,opened,with,a,bang,and,bran,s,heart,leapt,up,into,his,mouth,in,sudden,fear,but,it,was,only,maester,luwin,with,hodor,looming,in,the,stairway,behind,him,[END]
hodor,the,stableboy,announced,as,was,his,custom,smiling,hugely,at,them,all,[END]

hodor,will,you,help,bran,down,to,the,hall,[END]
hodor,hodor,agreed,happily,[END]
he,ducked,to,get,his,great,shaggy,head,under,the,door,[END]
hodor,was,nearly,seven,feet,tall,[END]
it,was,hard,to,believe,that,he,was,the,same,blood,as,old,nan,[END]
bran,wondered,if,he,would,shrivel,up,as,small,as,his,great-grandmother,when,he,was,old,[END]
it,did,not,seem,likely,even,if,hodor,lived,to,be,a,thousand,[END]
hodor,lifted,bran,as,easy,as,if,he,were,a,bale,of,hay,and,cradled,him,against,his,massive,chest,[END]
he,always,smelled,faintly,of,horses,but,it,was,not,a,bad,smell,[END]
his,arms,were,thick,with,muscle,and,matted,with,brown,hair,[END]
hodor,he,said,again,[END]
theon,greyjoy,had,once,commented,that,hodor,did,not,know,much,but,no,one,could,doubt,that,he,knew,his,name,[END]
old,nan,had,cackled,like,a,hen,when,bran,told,her,that,and,confessed,that,hodor,s,real,name,was,walder,[END]
no,one,knew,where,hodor,had,come,from,she,said,but,when,he,started,saying,it,they,started,calling,him,by,it,[END]
it,was,the,only,word,he,had,[END]
they,left,old,nan,in,the,tower,room,with,her,needles,and,her,memories,[END]
hodor,hummed,tunelessly,as,he,carried,bran,down,the,steps,and,through,the,gallery,with,maester,luwin,following,behind,hurrying,to,keep,up,with,the,stableboy,s,long,strides,[END]
robb,was,seated,in,father,s,high,seat,wearing,ringmail,and,boiled,leather,and,the,stern,face,of,robb,the,lord,[END]
theon,greyjoy,and,hallis,mollen,stood,behind,him,[END]
a,dozen,guardsmen,lined,the,grey,stone,walls,beneath,tall,narrow,windows,[END]

any,man,of,the,night,s,watch,is,welcome,here,at,winterfell,for,as,long,as,he,wishes,to,stay,robb,was,saying,with,the,voice,of,robb,the,lord,[END]
his,sword,was,across,his,knees,the,steel,bare,for,all,the,world,to,see,[END]
even,bran,knew,what,it,meant,to,greet,a,guest,with,an,unsheathed,sword,[END]
any,man,of,the,night,s,watch,the,dwarf,repeated,but,not,me,do,i,take,your,meaning,boy,[END]

i,am,the,lord,here,while,my,mother,and,father,are,away,lannister,[END]

your,bastard,brother,has,all,your,father,s,graces,it,would,seem,[END]

the,dwarf,turned,to,look,at,him,[END]

i,could,scarce,believe,it,[END]
you,starks,are,hard,to,kill,[END]
you,lannisters,had,best,remember,that,robb,said,lowering,his,sword,[END]
hodor,bring,my,brother,here,[END]
hodor,hodor,said,and,he,trotted,forward,smiling,and,set,bran,in,the,high,seat,of,the,starks,where,the,lords,of,winterfell,had,sat,since,the,days,when,they,called,themselves,the,kings,in,the,north,[END]
the,seat,was,cold,stone,polished,smooth,by,countless,bottoms,the,carved,heads,of,direwolves,snarled,on,the,ends,of,its,massive,arms,[END]
bran,clasped,them,as,he,sat,his,useless,legs,dangling,[END]
the,great,seat,made,him,feel,half,a,baby,[END]
robb,put,a,hand,on,his,shoulder,[END]
you,said,you,had,business,with,bran,[END]
well,here,he,is,lannister,[END]

nonsense,said,lannister,[END]
with,the,right,horse,and,the,right,saddle,even,a,cripple,can,ride,[END]
the,word,was,a,knife,through,bran,s,heart,[END]
he,felt,tears,come,unbidden,to,his,eyes,[END]
i,m,not,a,cripple,[END]
then,i,am,not,a,dwarf,the,dwarf,said,with,a,twist,of,his,mouth,[END]
my,father,will,rejoice,to,hear,it,greyjoy,laughed,[END]
what,sort,of,horse,and,saddle,are,you,suggesting,maester,luwin,asked,[END]
a,smart,horse,lannister,replied,[END]
the,boy,cannot,use,his,legs,to,command,the,animal,so,you,must,shape,the,horse,to,the,rider,teach,it,to,respond,to,the,reins,to,the,voice,[END]

to,be,sure,king,maekar,s,summer,was,hotter,than,this,one,and,near,as,long,[END]
there,were,fools,even,in,the,citadel,who,took,that,to,mean,that,the,great,summer,had,come,at,last,the,summer,that,never,ends,but,in,the,seventh,year,it,broke,suddenly,and,we,had,a,short,autumn,and,a,terrible,long,winter,[END]
still,the,heat,was,fierce,while,it,lasted,[END]
oldtown,steamed,and,sweltered,by,day,and,came,alive,only,by,night,[END]
we,would,walk,in,the,gardens,by,the,river,and,argue,about,the,gods,[END]
i,remember,the,smells,of,those,nights,my,lord,perfume,and,sweat,melons,ripe,to,bursting,peaches,and,pomegranates,nightshade,and,moonbloom,[END]

my,pardons,lord,eddard,[END]
you,did,not,come,to,hear,foolish,meanderings,of,a,summer,forgotten,before,your,father,was,born,[END]

it,was,pleasantly,cold,but,oversweet,to,his,taste,[END]
if,truth,be,told,the,hand,had,not,seemed,quite,himself,for,some,time,pycelle,said,[END]
we,had,sat,together,on,council,many,a,year,he,and,i,and,the,signs,were,there,to,read,but,i,put,them,down,to,the,great,burdens,he,had,borne,so,faithfully,for,so,long,[END]
those,broad,shoulders,were,weighed,down,by,all,the,cares,of,the,realm,and,more,besides,[END]
his,son,was,ever,sickly,and,his,lady,wife,so,anxious,that,she,would,scarcely,let,the,boy,out,of,her,sight,[END]
it,was,enough,to,weary,even,a,strong,man,and,the,lord,jon,was,not,young,[END]
small,wonder,if,he,seemed,melancholy,and,tired,[END]
or,so,i,thought,at,the,time,[END]
yet,now,i,am,less,certain,he,gave,a,ponderous,shake,of,his,head,[END]
what,can,you,tell,me,of,his,final,illness,[END]
the,grand,maester,spread,his,hands,in,a,gesture,of,helpless,sorrow,[END]
he,came,to,me,one,day,asking,after,a,certain,book,as,hale,and,healthy,as,ever,though,it,did,seem,to,me,that,something,was,troubling,him,deeply,[END]
the,next,morning,he,was,twisted,over,in,pain,too,sick,to,rise,from,bed,[END]
maester,colemon,thought,it,was,a,chill,on,the,stomach,[END]
the,weather,had,been,hot,and,the,hand,often,iced,his,wine,which,can,upset,the,digestion,[END]
when,lord,jon,continued,to,weaken,i,went,to,him,myself,but,the,gods,did,not,grant,me,the,power,to,save,him,[END]
i,have,heard,that,you,sent,maester,colemon,away,[END]
the,grand,maester,s,nod,was,as,slow,and,deliberate,as,a,glacier,[END]
i,did,and,i,fear,the,lady,lysa,will,never,forgive,me,that,[END]
maybe,i,was,wrong,but,at,the,time,i,thought,it,best,[END]
maester,colemon,is,like,a,son,to,me,and,i,yield,to,none,in,my,esteem,for,his,abilities,but,he,is,young,and,the,young,ofttimes,do,not,comprehend,the,frailty,of,an,older,body,[END]
he,was,purging,lord,arryn,with,wasting,potions,and,pepper,juice,and,i,feared,he,might,kill,him,[END]

pycelle,wrinkled,his,brow,[END]
in,the,last,stage,of,his,fever,the,hand,called,out,the,name,robert,several,times,but,whether,he,was,asking,for,his,son,or,for,the,king,i,could,not,say,[END]
lady,lysa,would,not,permit,the,boy,to,enter,the,sickroom,for,fear,that,he,too,might,be,taken,ill,the,king,did,come,and,he,sat,beside,the,bed,for,hours,talking,and,joking,of,times,long,past,in,hopes,of,raising,lord,jon,s,spirits,[END]
his,love,was,fierce,to,see,[END]

when,i,saw,that,all,hope,had,fled,i,gave,the,hand,the,milk,of,the,poppy,so,he,should,not,suffer,[END]
just,before,he,closed,his,eyes,for,the,last,time,he,whispered,something,to,the,king,and,his,lady,wife,a,blessing,for,his,son,[END]
the,seed,is,strong,he,said,[END]
at,the,end,his,speech,was,too,slurred,to,comprehend,[END]
death,did,not,come,until,the,next,morning,but,lord,jon,was,at,peace,after,that,[END]
he,never,spoke,again,[END]
ned,took,another,swallow,of,milk,trying,not,to,gag,on,the,sweetness,of,it,[END]
did,it,seem,to,you,that,there,was,anything,unnatural,about,lord,arryn,s,death,[END]
unnatural,the,aged,maester,s,voice,was,thin,as,a,whisper,[END]
no,i,could,not,say,so,[END]
sad,for,a,certainty,[END]
yet,in,its,own,way,death,is,the,most,natural,thing,of,all,lord,eddard,[END]

samwell,tarly,looked,at,him,for,a,long,moment,and,his,round,face,seemed,to,cave,in,on,itself,[END]
he,sat,down,on,the,frost-covered,ground,and,began,to,cry,huge,choking,sobs,that,made,his,whole,body,shake,[END]
jon,snow,could,only,stand,and,watch,[END]

the,fat,boy,cried,out,startled,and,somehow,in,a,heartbeat,his,sobs,turned,to,laughter,[END]

that,s,when,i,always,wake,his,skin,cold,and,clammy,shivering,in,the,darkness,of,his,cell,[END]
ghost,would,leap,up,beside,him,his,warmth,as,comforting,as,daybreak,[END]

after,a,long,while,samwell,tarly,began,to,talk,and,jon,snow,listened,quietly,and,learned,how,it,was,that,a,self-confessed,coward,found,himself,on,the,wall,[END]
the,tarlys,were,a,family,old,in,honor,bannermen,to,mace,tyrell,lord,of,highgarden,and,warden,of,the,south,[END]
the,eldest,son,of,lord,randyll,tarly,samwell,was,born,heir,to,rich,lands,a,strong,keep,and,a,storied,two-handed,greatsword,named,heartsbane,forged,of,valyrian,steel,and,passed,down,from,father,to,son,near,five,hundred,years,[END]
whatever,pride,his,lord,father,might,have,felt,at,samwell,s,birth,vanished,as,the,boy,grew,up,plump,soft,and,awkward,[END]
sam,loved,to,listen,to,music,and,make,his,own,songs,to,wear,soft,velvets,to,play,in,the,castle,kitchen,beside,the,cooks,drinking,in,the,rich,smells,as,he,snitched,lemon,cakes,and,blueberry,tarts,[END]
his,passions,were,books,and,kittens,and,dancing,clumsy,as,he,was,[END]
but,he,grew,ill,at,the,sight,of,blood,and,wept,to,see,even,a,chicken,slaughtered,[END]
a,dozen,masters-at-arms,came,and,went,at,horn,hill,trying,to,turn,samwell,into,the,knight,his,father,wanted,[END]
the,boy,was,cursed,and,caned,slapped,and,starved,[END]
one,man,had,him,sleep,in,his,chainmail,to,make,him,more,martial,[END]
another,dressed,him,in,his,mother,s,clothing,and,paraded,him,through,the,bailey,to,shame,him,into,valor,[END]
he,only,grew,fatter,and,more,frightened,until,lord,randyll,s,disappointment,turned,to,anger,and,then,to,loathing,[END]
one,time,sam,confided,his,voice,dropping,from,a,whisper,two,men,came,to,the,castle,warlocks,from,qarth,with,white,skin,and,blue,lips,[END]
they,slaughtered,a,bull,aurochs,and,made,me,bathe,in,the,hot,blood,but,it,didn,t,make,me,brave,as,they,d,promised,[END]
i,got,sick,and,retched,[END]

finally,after,three,girls,in,as,many,years,lady,tarly,gave,her,lord,husband,a,second,son,[END]
from,that,day,lord,randyll,ignored,sam,devoting,all,his,time,to,the,younger,boy,a,fierce,robust,child,more,to,his,liking,[END]
samwell,had,known,several,years,of,sweet,peace,with,his,music,and,his,books,[END]
until,the,dawn,of,his,fifteenth,name,day,when,he,had,been,awakened,to,find,his,horse,saddled,and,ready,[END]
three,men-at-arms,had,escorted,him,into,a,wood,near,horn,hill,where,his,father,was,skinning,a,deer,[END]

the,southern,rain,was,soft,and,warm,[END]

it,took,her,back,to,her,childhood,to,long,grey,days,at,riverrun,[END]
she,remembered,the,godswood,drooping,branches,heavy,with,moisture,and,the,sound,of,her,brother,s,laughter,as,he,chased,her,through,piles,of,damp,leaves,[END]

it,was,as,likely,to,kill,a,crop,as,nurture,it,and,it,sent,grown,men,running,for,the,nearest,shelter,[END]

the,banner,in,the,hand,of,the,foremost,rider,hung,sodden,and,limp,but,the,guardsmen,wore,indigo,cloaks,and,on,their,shoulders,flew,the,silver,eagle,of,seagard,[END]

they,were,riding,for,king,s,landing,and,the,hand,s,tourney,she,knew,[END]
for,the,past,week,the,travelers,had,been,thick,as,flies,upon,the,kingsroad,knights,and,freeriders,singers,with,their,harps,and,drums,heavy,wagons,laden,with,hops,or,corn,or,casks,of,honey,traders,and,craftsmen,and,whores,and,all,of,them,moving,south,[END]
she,studied,lord,jason,boldly,[END]
the,last,time,she,had,seen,him,he,had,been,jesting,with,her,uncle,at,her,wedding,feast,the,mallisters,stood,bannermen,to,the,tullys,and,his,gifts,had,been,lavish,[END]
his,brown,hair,was,salted,with,white,now,his,face,chiseled,gaunt,by,time,yet,the,years,had,not,touched,his,pride,[END]
he,rode,like,a,man,who,feared,nothing,[END]
catelyn,envied,him,that,she,had,come,to,fear,so,much,[END]
as,the,riders,passed,lord,jason,nodded,a,curt,greeting,but,it,was,only,a,high,lord,s,courtesy,to,strangers,chance,met,on,the,road,[END]
there,was,no,recognition,in,those,fierce,eyes,and,his,son,did,not,even,waste,a,look,[END]
he,did,not,know,you,ser,rodrik,said,after,wondering,[END]
he,saw,a,pair,of,mud-spattered,travelers,by,the,side,of,the,road,wet,and,tired,[END]
it,would,never,occur,to,him,to,suspect,that,one,of,them,was,the,daughter,of,his,liege,lord,[END]
i,think,we,shall,be,safe,enough,at,the,inn,ser,rodrik,[END]
it,was,near,dark,when,they,reached,it,at,the,crossroads,north,of,the,great,confluence,of,the,trident,[END]
masha,heddle,was,fatter,and,greyer,than,catelyn,remembered,still,chewing,her,sourleaf,but,she,gave,them,only,the,most,cursory,of,looks,with,nary,a,hint,of,her,ghastly,red,smile,[END]
two,rooms,at,the,top,of,the,stair,that,s,all,there,is,she,said,chewing,all,the,while,[END]

those,who,come,late,to,meals,don,t,eat,there,were,no,smiles,and,no,mention,of,sweet,cakes,[END]
when,the,supper,bell,rang,the,sound,was,deafening,[END]
catelyn,had,changed,into,dry,clothes,[END]
she,sat,by,the,window,watching,rain,run,down,the,pane,[END]
the,glass,was,milky,and,full,of,bubbles,and,a,wet,dusk,was,falling,outside,[END]
catelyn,could,just,make,out,the,muddy,crossing,where,the,two,great,roads,met,[END]
the,crossroads,gave,her,pause,[END]
if,they,turned,west,from,here,it,was,an,easy,ride,down,to,riverrun,[END]
her,father,had,always,given,her,wise,counsel,when,she,needed,it,most,and,she,yearned,to,talk,to,him,to,warn,him,of,the,gathering,storm,[END]
if,winterfell,needed,to,brace,for,war,how,much,more,so,riverrun,so,much,closer,to,king,s,landing,with,the,power,of,casterly,rock,looming,to,the,west,like,a,shadow,[END]
if,only,her,father,had,been,stronger,she,might,have,chanced,it,but,hoster,tully,had,been,bedridden,these,past,two,years,and,catelyn,was,loath,to,tax,him,now,[END]
the,eastern,road,was,wilder,and,more,dangerous,climbing,through,rocky,foothills,and,thick,forests,into,the,mountains,of,the,moon,past,high,passes,and,deep,chasms,to,the,vale,of,arryn,and,the,stony,fingers,beyond,[END]
above,the,vale,the,eyrie,stood,high,and,impregnable,its,towers,reaching,for,the,sky,[END]
there,she,would,find,her,sister,and,perhaps,some,of,the,answers,ned,sought,[END]
surely,lysa,knew,more,than,she,had,dared,to,put,in,her,letter,[END]
she,might,have,the,very,proof,that,ned,needed,to,bring,the,lannisters,to,ruin,and,if,it,came,to,war,they,would,need,the,arryns,and,the,eastern,lords,who,owed,them,service,[END]
yet,the,mountain,road,was,perilous,[END]
shadowcats,prowled,those,passes,rock,slides,were,common,and,the,mountain,clans,were,lawless,brigands,descending,from,the,heights,to,rob,and,kill,and,melting,away,like,snow,whenever,the,knights,rode,out,from,the,vale,in,search,of,them,[END]
even,jon,arryn,as,great,a,lord,as,any,the,eyrie,had,ever,known,had,always,traveled,in,strength,when,he,crossed,the,mountains,[END]
catelyn,s,only,strength,was,one,elderly,knight,armored,in,loyalty,[END]
no,she,thought,riverrun,and,the,eyrie,would,have,to,wait,[END]
her,path,ran,north,to,winterfell,where,her,sons,and,her,duty,were,waiting,for,her,[END]
as,soon,as,they,were,safely,past,the,neck,she,could,declare,herself,to,one,of,ned,s,bannermen,and,send,riders,racing,ahead,with,orders,to,mount,a,watch,on,the,kingsroad,[END]
the,rain,obscured,the,fields,beyond,the,crossroads,but,catelyn,saw,the,land,clear,enough,in,her,memory,[END]
the,marketplace,was,just,across,the,way,and,the,village,a,mile,farther,on,half,a,hundred,white,cottages,surrounding,a,small,stone,sept,there,would,be,more,now,the,summer,had,been,long,and,peaceful,[END]
north,of,here,the,kingsroad,ran,along,the,green,fork,of,the,trident,through,fertile,valleys,and,green,woodlands,past,thriving,towns,and,stout,holdfasts,and,the,castles,of,the,river,lords,[END]
catelyn,knew,them,all,the,blackwoods,and,the,brackens,ever,enemies,whose,quarrels,her,father,was,obliged,to,settle,lady,whent,last,of,her,line,who,dwelt,with,her,ghosts,in,the,cavernous,vaults,of,harrenhal,irascible,lord,frey,who,had,outlived,seven,wives,and,filled,his,twin,castles,with,children,grandchildren,and,great-grandchildren,and,bastards,and,grandbastards,as,well,[END]
all,of,them,were,bannermen,to,the,tullys,their,swords,sworn,to,the,service,of,riverrun,[END]
catelyn,wondered,if,that,would,be,enough,if,it,came,to,war,[END]
her,father,was,the,staunchest,man,who,d,ever,lived,and,she,had,no,doubt,that,he,would,call,his,banners,but,would,the,banners,come,[END]
the,darrys,and,rygers,and,mootons,had,sworn,oaths,to,riverrun,as,well,yet,they,had,fought,with,rhaegar,targaryen,on,the,trident,while,lord,frey,had,arrived,with,his,levies,well,after,the,battle,was,over,leaving,some,doubt,as,to,which,army,he,had,planned,to,join,theirs,he,had,assured,the,victors,solemnly,in,the,aftermath,but,ever,after,her,father,had,called,him,the,late,lord,frey,[END]
it,must,not,come,to,war,catelyn,thought,fervently,[END]
they,must,not,let,it,[END]
ser,rodrik,came,for,her,just,as,the,bell,ceased,its,clangor,[END]
we,had,best,make,haste,if,we,hope,to,eat,tonight,my,lady,[END]
it,might,be,safer,if,we,were,not,knight,and,lady,until,we,pass,the,neck,she,told,him,[END]

a,father,and,daughter,taken,to,the,road,on,some,family,business,say,[END]
as,you,say,my,lady,ser,rodrik,agreed,[END]
it,was,only,when,she,laughed,that,he,realized,what,he,d,done,[END]
the,old,courtesies,die,hard,my,my,daughter,he,tried,to,tug,on,his,missing,whiskers,and,sighed,with,exasperation,[END]

you,ll,find,that,masha,heddle,sets,a,good,table,i,think,but,try,not,to,praise,her,[END]
you,truly,don,t,want,to,see,her,smile,[END]
the,common,room,was,long,and,drafty,with,a,row,of,huge,wooden,kegs,at,one,end,and,a,fireplace,at,the,other,[END]
a,serving,boy,ran,back,and,forth,with,skewers,of,meat,while,masha,drew,beer,from,the,kegs,chewing,her,sourleaf,all,the,while,[END]
the,benches,were,crowded,townsfolk,and,farmers,mingling,freely,with,all,manner,of,travelers,[END]
the,crossroads,made,for,odd,companions,dyers,with,black,and,purple,hands,shared,a,bench,with,rivermen,reeking,of,fish,an,ironsmith,thick,with,muscle,squeezed,in,beside,a,wizened,old,septon,hard-bitten,sellswords,and,soft,plump,merchants,swapped,news,like,boon,companions,[END]
the,company,included,more,swords,than,catelyn,would,have,liked,[END]
three,by,the,fire,wore,the,red,stallion,badge,of,the,brackens,and,there,was,a,large,party,in,blue,steel,ringmail,and,capes,of,a,silvery,grey,[END]
on,their,shoulder,was,another,familiar,sigil,the,twin,towers,of,house,frey,[END]
she,studied,their,faces,but,they,were,all,too,young,to,have,known,her,[END]
the,senior,among,them,would,have,been,no,older,than,bran,when,she,went,north,[END]
ser,rodrik,found,them,an,empty,place,on,the,bench,near,the,kitchen,[END]
across,the,table,a,handsome,youth,was,fingering,a,woodharp,[END]
seven,blessings,to,you,goodfolk,he,said,as,they,sat,[END]
an,empty,wine,cup,stood,on,the,table,before,him,[END]
and,to,you,singer,catelyn,returned,[END]
ser,rodrik,called,for,bread,and,meat,and,beer,in,a,tone,that,meant,now,[END]
the,singer,a,youth,of,some,eighteen,years,eyed,them,boldly,and,asked,where,they,were,going,and,from,whence,they,had,come,and,what,news,they,had,letting,the,questions,fly,as,quick,as,arrows,and,never,pausing,for,an,answer,[END]
we,left,king,s,landing,a,fortnight,ago,catelyn,replied,answering,the,safest,of,his,questions,[END]
that,s,where,i,m,bound,the,youth,said,[END]
as,she,had,suspected,he,was,more,interested,in,telling,his,own,story,than,in,hearing,theirs,[END]

the,gods,frown,on,the,gambler,ser,rodrik,said,sternly,[END]

your,cruel,gods,and,the,knight,of,flowers,altogether,did,me,in,[END]
no,doubt,that,was,a,lesson,for,you,ser,rodrik,said,[END]

ser,rodrik,tried,to,tug,at,whiskers,that,were,not,there,but,before,he,could,frame,a,rebuke,the,serving,boy,came,scurrying,up,[END]
he,laid,trenchers,of,bread,before,them,and,filled,them,with,chunks,of,browned,meat,off,a,skewer,dripping,with,hot,juice,[END]
another,skewer,held,tiny,onions,fire,peppers,and,fat,mushrooms,[END]

my,name,is,marillion,the,singer,said,plucking,a,string,on,his,woodharp,[END]
doubtless,you,ve,heard,me,play,somewhere,[END]
his,manner,made,catelyn,smile,[END]

i,fear,not,she,told,him,[END]
he,drew,a,plaintive,chord,from,the,woodharp,[END]
that,is,your,loss,he,said,[END]
who,was,the,finest,singer,you,ve,ever,heard,[END]

his,opinion,of,singers,was,well,known,music,was,a,lovely,thing,for,girls,but,he,could,not,comprehend,why,any,healthy,boy,would,fill,his,hand,with,a,harp,when,he,might,have,had,a,sword,[END]
your,grandfather,has,a,sour,nature,marillion,said,to,catelyn,[END]

jory,looks,a,beggar,among,these,others,septa,mordane,sniffed,when,he,appeared,[END]

jory,s,armor,was,blue-grey,plate,without,device,or,ornament,and,a,thin,grey,cloak,hung,from,his,shoulders,like,a,soiled,rag,[END]
yet,he,acquitted,himself,well,unhorsing,horas,redwyne,in,his,first,joust,and,one,of,the,freys,in,his,second,[END]
in,his,third,match,he,rode,three,passes,at,a,freerider,named,lothor,brune,whose,armor,was,as,drab,as,his,own,[END]

the,jousting,went,all,day,and,into,the,dusk,the,hooves,of,the,great,warhorses,pounding,down,the,lists,until,the,field,was,a,ragged,wasteland,of,torn,earth,[END]
a,dozen,times,jeyne,and,sansa,cried,out,in,unison,as,riders,crashed,together,lances,exploding,into,splinters,while,the,commons,screamed,for,their,favorites,[END]
jeyne,covered,her,eyes,whenever,a,man,fell,like,a,frightened,little,girl,but,sansa,was,made,of,sterner,stuff,[END]
a,great,lady,knew,how,to,behave,at,tournaments,[END]
even,septa,mordane,noted,her,composure,and,nodded,in,approval,[END]
the,kingslayer,rode,brilliantly,[END]
he,overthrew,ser,andar,royce,and,the,marcher,lord,bryce,caron,as,easily,as,if,he,were,riding,at,rings,and,then,took,a,hard-fought,match,from,white-haired,barristan,selmy,who,had,won,his,first,two,tilts,against,men,thirty,and,forty,years,his,junior,[END]
sandor,clegane,and,his,immense,brother,ser,gregor,the,mountain,seemed,unstoppable,as,well,riding,down,one,foe,after,the,next,in,ferocious,style,[END]
the,most,terrifying,moment,of,the,day,came,during,ser,gregor,s,second,joust,when,his,lance,rode,up,and,struck,a,young,knight,from,the,vale,under,the,gorget,with,such,force,that,it,drove,through,his,throat,killing,him,instantly,[END]
the,youth,fell,not,ten,feet,from,where,sansa,was,seated,[END]
the,point,of,ser,gregor,s,lance,had,snapped,off,in,his,neck,and,his,life,s,blood,flowed,out,in,slow,pulses,each,weaker,than,the,one,before,[END]
his,armor,was,shiny,new,a,bright,streak,of,fire,ran,down,his,outstretched,arm,as,the,steel,caught,the,light,[END]
then,the,sun,went,behind,a,cloud,and,it,was,gone,[END]
his,cloak,was,blue,the,color,of,the,sky,on,a,clear,summer,s,day,trimmed,with,a,border,of,crescent,moons,but,as,his,blood,seeped,into,it,the,cloth,darkened,and,the,moons,turned,red,one,by,one,[END]
jeyne,poole,wept,so,hysterically,that,septa,mordane,finally,took,her,off,to,regain,her,composure,but,sansa,sat,with,her,hands,folded,in,her,lap,watching,with,a,strange,fascination,[END]
she,had,never,seen,a,man,die,before,[END]
she,ought,to,be,crying,too,she,thought,but,the,tears,would,not,come,[END]
perhaps,she,had,used,up,all,her,tears,for,lady,and,bran,[END]
it,would,be,different,if,it,had,been,jory,or,ser,rodrik,or,father,she,told,herself,[END]
the,young,knight,in,the,blue,cloak,was,nothing,to,her,some,stranger,from,the,vale,of,arryn,whose,name,she,had,forgotten,as,soon,as,she,heard,it,[END]
and,now,the,world,would,forget,his,name,too,sansa,realized,there,would,be,no,songs,sung,for,him,[END]
that,was,sad,[END]
after,they,carried,off,the,body,a,boy,with,a,spade,ran,onto,the,field,and,shoveled,dirt,over,the,spot,where,he,had,fallen,to,cover,up,the,blood,[END]
then,the,jousts,resumed,[END]
ser,balon,swann,also,fell,to,gregor,and,lord,renly,to,the,hound,[END]
renly,was,unhorsed,so,violently,that,he,seemed,to,fly,backward,off,his,charger,legs,in,the,air,[END]
his,head,hit,the,ground,with,an,audible,crack,that,made,the,crowd,gasp,but,it,was,just,the,golden,antler,on,his,helm,[END]
one,of,the,tines,had,snapped,off,beneath,him,[END]
when,lord,renly,climbed,to,his,feet,the,commons,cheered,wildly,for,king,robert,s,handsome,young,brother,was,a,great,favorite,[END]
he,handed,the,broken,tine,to,his,conqueror,with,a,gracious,bow,[END]
the,hound,snorted,and,tossed,the,broken,antler,into,the,crowd,where,the,commons,began,to,punch,and,claw,over,the,little,bit,of,gold,until,lord,renly,walked,out,among,them,and,restored,the,peace,[END]
by,then,septa,mordane,had,returned,alone,[END]
jeyne,had,been,feeling,ill,she,explained,she,had,helped,her,back,to,the,castle,[END]
sansa,had,almost,forgotten,about,jeyne,[END]
later,a,hedge,knight,in,a,checkered,cloak,disgraced,himself,by,killing,beric,dondarrion,s,horse,and,was,declared,forfeit,[END]
lord,beric,shifted,his,saddle,to,a,new,mount,only,to,be,knocked,right,off,it,by,thoros,of,myr,[END]
ser,aron,santagar,and,lothor,brune,tilted,thrice,without,result,ser,aron,fell,afterward,to,lord,jason,mallister,and,brune,to,yohn,royce,s,younger,son,robar,[END]
in,the,end,it,came,down,to,four,the,hound,and,his,monstrous,brother,gregor,jaime,lannister,the,kingslayer,and,ser,loras,tyrell,the,youth,they,called,the,knight,of,flowers,[END]
ser,loras,was,the,youngest,son,of,mace,tyrell,the,lord,of,highgarden,and,warden,of,the,south,[END]
at,sixteen,he,was,the,youngest,rider,on,the,field,yet,he,had,unhorsed,three,knights,of,the,kingsguard,that,morning,in,his,first,three,jousts,[END]
sansa,had,never,seen,anyone,so,beautiful,[END]
his,plate,was,intricately,fashioned,and,enameled,as,a,bouquet,of,a,thousand,different,flowers,and,his,snow-white,stallion,was,draped,in,a,blanket,of,red,and,white,roses,[END]
after,each,victory,ser,loras,would,remove,his,helm,and,ride,slowly,round,the,fence,and,finally,pluck,a,single,white,rose,from,the,blanket,and,toss,it,to,some,fair,maiden,in,the,crowd,[END]
his,last,match,of,the,day,was,against,the,younger,royce,[END]
ser,robar,s,ancestral,runes,proved,small,protection,as,ser,loras,split,his,shield,and,drove,him,from,his,saddle,to,crash,with,an,awful,clangor,in,the,dirt,[END]
robar,lay,moaning,as,the,victor,made,his,circuit,of,the,field,[END]
finally,they,called,for,a,litter,and,carried,him,off,to,his,tent,dazed,and,unmoving,[END]
sansa,never,saw,it,[END]
her,eyes,were,only,for,ser,loras,[END]
when,the,white,horse,stopped,in,front,of,her,she,thought,her,heart,would,burst,[END]
to,the,other,maidens,he,had,given,white,roses,but,the,one,he,plucked,for,her,was,red,[END]
sweet,lady,he,said,no,victory,is,half,so,beautiful,as,you,sansa,took,the,flower,timidly,struck,dumb,by,his,gallantry,[END]
his,hair,was,a,mass,of,lazy,brown,curls,his,eyes,like,liquid,gold,[END]
she,inhaled,the,sweet,fragrance,of,the,rose,and,sat,clutching,it,long,after,ser,loras,had,ridden,off,[END]
when,sansa,finally,looked,up,a,man,was,standing,over,her,staring,[END]
he,was,short,with,a,pointed,beard,and,a,silver,streak,in,his,hair,almost,as,old,as,her,father,[END]
you,must,be,one,of,her,daughters,he,said,to,her,[END]

you,have,the,tully,look,[END]
i,m,sansa,stark,she,said,ill,at,ease,[END]
the,man,wore,a,heavy,cloak,with,a,fur,collar,fastened,with,a,silver,mockingbird,and,he,had,the,effortless,manner,of,a,high,lord,but,she,did,not,know,him,[END]

you,have,her,hair,his,fingers,brushed,against,her,cheek,as,he,stroked,one,auburn,lock,[END]
quite,abruptly,he,turned,and,walked,away,[END]
by,then,the,moon,was,well,up,and,the,crowd,was,tired,so,the,king,decreed,that,the,last,three,matches,would,be,fought,the,next,morning,before,the,melee,[END]
while,the,commons,began,their,walk,home,talking,of,the,day,s,jousts,and,the,matches,to,come,on,the,morrow,the,court,moved,to,the,riverside,to,begin,the,feast,[END]
six,monstrous,huge,aurochs,had,been,roasting,for,hours,turning,slowly,on,wooden,spits,while,kitchen,boys,basted,them,with,butter,and,herbs,until,the,meat,crackled,and,spit,[END]
tables,and,benches,had,been,raised,outside,the,pavilions,piled,high,with,sweetgrass,and,strawberries,and,fresh-baked,bread,[END]

when,prince,joffrey,seated,himself,to,her,right,she,felt,her,throat,tighten,[END]
he,had,not,spoken,a,word,to,her,since,the,awful,thing,had,happened,and,she,had,not,dared,to,speak,to,him,[END]
at,first,she,thought,she,hated,him,for,what,they,d,done,to,lady,but,after,sansa,had,wept,her,eyes,dry,she,told,herself,that,it,had,not,been,joffrey,s,doing,not,truly,[END]
the,queen,had,done,it,she,was,the,one,to,hate,her,and,arya,[END]
nothing,bad,would,have,happened,except,for,arya,[END]
she,could,not,hate,joffrey,tonight,[END]
he,was,too,beautiful,to,hate,[END]
he,wore,a,deep,blue,doublet,studded,with,a,double,row,of,golden,lion,s,heads,and,around,his,brow,a,slim,coronet,made,of,gold,and,sapphires,[END]
his,hair,was,as,bright,as,the,metal,[END]
sansa,looked,at,him,and,trembled,afraid,that,he,might,ignore,her,or,worse,turn,hateful,again,and,send,her,weeping,from,the,table,[END]
instead,joffrey,smiled,and,kissed,her,hand,handsome,and,gallant,as,any,prince,in,the,songs,and,said,ser,loras,has,a,keen,eye,for,beauty,sweet,lady,[END]
he,was,too,kind,she,demurred,trying,to,remain,modest,and,calm,though,her,heart,was,singing,[END]

the,memory,was,still,bitter,[END]
one,moment,he,d,been,ordering,supper,and,an,eye,blink,later,he,was,facing,a,room,of,armed,men,with,jyck,reaching,for,a,sword,and,the,fat,innkeep,shrieking,no,swords,not,here,please,m,lords,[END]
tyrion,wrenched,down,jyck,s,arm,hurriedly,before,he,got,them,both,hacked,to,pieces,[END]
where,are,your,courtesies,jyck,[END]
our,good,hostess,said,no,swords,[END]
do,as,she,asks,he,forced,a,smile,that,must,have,looked,as,queasy,as,it,felt,[END]
you,re,making,a,sad,mistake,lady,stark,[END]
i,had,no,part,in,any,attack,on,your,son,[END]
on,my,honor,[END]
lannister,honor,was,all,she,said,[END]
she,held,up,her,hands,for,all,the,room,to,see,[END]
his,dagger,left,these,scars,[END]
the,blade,he,sent,to,open,my,son,s,throat,[END]
tyrion,felt,the,anger,all,around,him,thick,and,smoky,fed,by,the,deep,cuts,in,the,stark,woman,s,hands,[END]
kill,him,hissed,some,drunken,slattern,from,the,back,and,other,voices,took,up,the,call,faster,than,he,would,have,believed,[END]
strangers,all,friendly,enough,only,a,moment,ago,and,yet,now,they,cried,for,his,blood,like,hounds,on,a,trail,[END]
tyrion,spoke,up,loudly,trying,to,keep,the,quaver,from,his,voice,[END]
if,lady,stark,believes,i,have,some,crime,to,answer,for,i,will,go,with,her,and,answer,for,it,[END]
it,was,the,only,possible,course,[END]
trying,to,cut,their,way,out,of,this,was,a,sure,invitation,to,an,early,grave,[END]
a,good,dozen,swords,had,responded,to,the,stark,woman,s,plea,for,help,the,harrenhal,man,the,three,brackens,a,pair,of,unsavory,sellswords,who,looked,as,though,they,d,kill,him,as,soon,as,spit,and,some,fool,field,hands,who,doubtless,had,no,idea,what,they,were,doing,[END]
against,that,what,did,tyrion,have,[END]
a,dagger,at,his,belt,and,two,men,[END]
jyck,swung,a,fair,enough,sword,but,morrec,scarcely,counted,he,was,part,groom,part,cook,part,body,servant,and,no,soldier,[END]
as,for,yoren,whatever,his,feelings,might,have,been,the,black,brothers,were,sworn,to,take,no,part,in,the,quarrels,of,the,realm,[END]
yoren,would,do,nothing,[END]
and,indeed,the,black,brother,stepped,aside,silently,when,the,old,knight,by,catelyn,stark,s,side,said,take,their,weapons,and,the,sellsword,bronn,stepped,forward,to,pull,the,sword,from,jyck,s,fingers,and,relieve,them,all,of,their,daggers,[END]
good,the,old,man,said,as,the,tension,in,the,common,room,ebbed,palpably,excellent,tyrion,recognized,the,gruff,voice,winterfell,s,master-at-arms,shorn,of,his,whiskers,[END]
scarlet-tinged,spittle,flew,from,the,fat,innkeep,s,mouth,as,she,begged,of,catelyn,stark,don,t,kill,him,here,[END]
don,t,kill,him,anywhere,tyrion,urged,[END]
take,him,somewheres,else,no,blood,here,m,lady,i,wants,no,high,lordlin,s,quarrels,[END]
we,are,taking,him,back,to,winterfell,she,said,and,tyrion,thought,well,perhaps,by,then,he,d,had,a,moment,to,glance,over,the,room,and,get,a,better,idea,of,the,situation,[END]
he,was,not,altogether,displeased,by,what,he,saw,[END]
oh,the,stark,woman,had,been,clever,no,doubt,of,it,[END]
force,them,to,make,a,public,affirmation,of,the,oaths,sworn,her,father,by,the,lords,they,served,and,then,call,on,them,for,succor,and,her,a,woman,yes,that,was,sweet,[END]
yet,her,success,was,not,as,complete,as,she,might,have,liked,[END]
there,were,close,to,fifty,in,the,common,room,by,his,rough,count,[END]
catelyn,stark,s,plea,had,roused,a,bare,dozen,the,others,looked,confused,or,frightened,or,sullen,[END]
only,two,of,the,freys,had,stirred,tyrion,noted,and,they,d,sat,back,down,quick,enough,when,their,captain,failed,to,move,[END]
he,might,have,smiled,if,he,d,dared,[END]
winterfell,it,is,then,he,said,instead,[END]
that,was,a,long,ride,as,he,could,well,attest,having,just,ridden,it,the,other,way,[END]
so,many,things,could,happen,along,the,way,[END]
my,father,will,wonder,what,has,become,of,me,he,added,catching,the,eye,of,the,swordsman,who,d,offered,to,yield,up,his,room,[END]
he,ll,pay,a,handsome,reward,to,any,man,who,brings,him,word,of,what,happened,here,today,lord,tywin,would,do,no,such,thing,of,course,but,tyrion,would,make,up,for,it,if,he,won,free,[END]
ser,rodrik,glanced,at,his,lady,his,look,worried,as,well,it,might,be,[END]
his,men,come,with,him,the,old,knight,announced,[END]
and,we,ll,thank,the,rest,of,you,to,stay,quiet,about,what,you,ve,seen,here,[END]
it,was,all,tyrion,could,do,not,to,laugh,[END]
quiet,[END]
the,old,fool,[END]
unless,he,took,the,whole,inn,the,word,would,begin,to,spread,the,instant,they,were,gone,[END]
the,freerider,with,the,gold,coin,in,his,pocket,would,fly,to,casterly,rock,like,an,arrow,[END]
if,not,him,then,someone,else,[END]
yoren,would,carry,the,story,south,[END]
that,fool,singer,might,make,a,lay,of,it,[END]
the,freys,would,report,back,to,their,lord,and,the,gods,only,knew,what,he,might,do,[END]
lord,walder,frey,might,be,sworn,to,riverrun,but,he,was,a,cautious,man,who,had,lived,a,long,time,by,making,certain,he,was,always,on,the,winning,side,[END]
at,the,very,least,he,would,send,his,birds,winging,south,to,king,s,landing,and,he,might,well,dare,more,than,that,[END]
catelyn,stark,wasted,no,time,[END]
we,must,ride,at,once,[END]
we,ll,want,fresh,mounts,and,provisions,for,the,road,[END]
you,men,know,that,you,have,the,eternal,gratitude,of,house,stark,[END]
if,any,of,you,choose,to,help,us,guard,our,captives,and,get,them,safe,to,winterfell,i,promise,you,shall,be,well,rewarded,that,was,all,it,took,the,fools,came,rushing,forward,[END]
tyrion,studied,their,faces,they,would,indeed,be,well,rewarded,he,vowed,to,himself,but,perhaps,not,quite,as,they,imagined,[END]
yet,even,as,they,were,bundling,him,outside,saddling,the,horses,in,the,rain,and,tying,his,hands,with,a,length,of,coarse,rope,tyrion,lannister,was,not,truly,afraid,[END]
they,would,never,get,him,to,winterfell,he,would,have,given,odds,on,that,[END]
riders,would,be,after,them,within,the,day,birds,would,take,wing,and,surely,one,of,the,river,lords,would,want,to,curry,favor,with,his,father,enough,to,take,a,hand,[END]
tyrion,was,congratulating,himself,on,his,subtlety,when,someone,pulled,a,hood,down,over,his,eyes,and,lifted,him,up,onto,a,saddle,[END]
they,set,out,through,the,rain,at,a,hard,gallop,and,before,long,tyrion,s,thighs,were,cramped,and,aching,and,his,butt,throbbed,with,pain,[END]
even,when,they,were,safely,away,from,the,inn,and,catelyn,stark,slowed,them,to,a,trot,it,was,a,miserable,pounding,journey,over,rough,ground,made,worse,by,his,blindness,[END]
every,twist,and,turn,put,him,in,danger,of,falling,off,his,horse,[END]
the,hood,muffled,sound,so,he,could,not,make,out,what,was,being,said,around,him,and,the,rain,soaked,through,the,cloth,and,made,it,cling,to,his,face,until,even,breathing,was,a,struggle,[END]
the,rope,chafed,his,wrists,raw,and,seemed,to,grow,tighter,as,the,night,wore,on,[END]
i,was,about,to,settle,down,to,a,warm,fire,and,a,roast,fowl,and,that,wretched,singer,had,to,open,his,mouth,he,thought,mournfully,[END]
the,wretched,singer,had,come,along,with,them,[END]
there,is,a,great,song,to,be,made,from,this,and,i,m,the,one,to,make,it,he,told,catelyn,stark,when,he,announced,his,intention,of,riding,with,them,to,see,how,the,splendid,adventure,turned,out,[END]
tyrion,wondered,whether,the,boy,would,think,the,adventure,quite,so,splendid,once,the,lannister,riders,caught,up,with,them,[END]
the,rain,had,finally,stopped,and,dawn,light,was,seeping,through,the,wet,cloth,over,his,eyes,when,catelyn,stark,gave,the,command,to,dismount,[END]
rough,hands,pulled,him,down,from,his,horse,untied,his,wrists,and,yanked,the,hood,off,his,head,[END]
when,he,saw,the,narrow,stony,road,the,foothills,rising,high,and,wild,all,around,them,and,the,jagged,snowcapped,peaks,on,the,distant,horizon,all,the,hope,went,out,of,him,in,a,rush,[END]
this,is,the,high,road,he,gasped,looking,at,lady,stark,with,accusation,[END]
the,eastern,road,[END]
you,said,we,were,riding,for,winterfell,[END]
catelyn,stark,favored,him,with,the,faintest,of,smiles,[END]
often,and,loudly,she,agreed,[END]
no,doubt,your,friends,will,ride,that,way,when,they,come,after,us,[END]
i,wish,them,good,speed,[END]
even,now,long,days,later,the,memory,filled,him,with,a,bitter,rage,[END]
all,his,life,tyrion,had,prided,himself,on,his,cunning,the,only,gift,the,gods,had,seen,fit,to,give,him,and,yet,this,seven-times-damned,she-wolf,catelyn,stark,had,outwitted,him,at,every,turn,[END]
the,knowledge,was,more,galling,than,the,bare,fact,of,his,abduction,[END]
they,stopped,only,as,long,as,it,took,to,feed,and,water,the,horses,and,then,they,were,off,again,[END]
this,time,tyrion,was,spared,the,hood,[END]
after,the,second,night,they,no,longer,bound,his,hands,and,once,they,had,gained,the,heights,they,scarcely,bothered,to,guard,him,at,all,[END]
it,seemed,they,did,not,fear,his,escape,[END]
and,why,should,they,[END]
up,here,the,land,was,harsh,and,wild,and,the,high,road,little,more,than,a,stony,track,[END]
if,he,did,run,how,far,could,he,hope,to,go,alone,and,without,provisions,[END]
the,shadowcats,would,make,a,morsel,of,him,and,the,clans,that,dwelt,in,the,mountain,fastnesses,were,brigands,and,murderers,who,bowed,to,no,law,but,the,sword,[END]
yet,still,the,stark,woman,drove,them,forward,relentlessly,[END]
he,knew,where,they,were,bound,[END]
he,had,known,it,since,the,moment,they,pulled,off,his,hood,[END]
these,mountains,were,the,domain,of,house,arryn,and,the,late,hand,s,widow,was,a,tully,catelyn,stark,s,sister,and,no,friend,to,the,lannisters,[END]
tyrion,had,known,the,lady,lysa,slightly,during,her,years,at,king,s,landing,and,did,not,look,forward,to,renewing,the,acquaintance,[END]
his,captors,were,clustered,around,a,stream,a,short,ways,down,the,high,road,[END]
the,horses,had,drunk,their,fill,of,the,icy,cold,water,and,were,grazing,on,clumps,of,brown,grass,that,grew,from,clefts,in,the,rock,[END]
jyck,and,morrec,huddled,close,sullen,and,miserable,[END]
mohor,stood,over,them,leaning,on,his,spear,and,wearing,a,rounded,iron,cap,that,made,him,look,as,if,he,had,a,bowl,on,his,head,[END]
nearby,marillion,the,singer,sat,oiling,his,woodharp,complaining,of,what,the,damp,was,doing,to,his,strings,[END]
we,must,have,some,rest,my,lady,the,hedge,knight,ser,willis,wode,was,saying,to,catelyn,stark,as,tyrion,approached,[END]
he,was,lady,whent,s,man,stiff-necked,and,stolid,and,the,first,to,rise,to,aid,catelyn,stark,back,at,the,inn,[END]
ser,willis,speaks,truly,my,lady,ser,rodrik,said,[END]
this,is,the,third,horse,we,have,lost,[END]
we,will,lose,more,than,horses,if,we,re,overtaken,by,the,lannisters,she,reminded,them,[END]
her,face,was,windburnt,and,gaunt,but,it,had,lost,none,of,its,determination,[END]
small,chance,of,that,here,tyrion,put,in,[END]
the,lady,did,not,ask,your,views,dwarf,snapped,kurleket,a,great,fat,oaf,with,short-cropped,hair,and,a,pig,s,face,[END]
he,was,one,of,the,brackens,a,man-at-arms,in,the,service,of,lord,jonos,[END]
tyrion,had,made,a,special,effort,to,learn,all,their,names,so,he,might,thank,them,later,for,their,tender,treatment,of,him,[END]
a,lannister,always,paid,his,debts,[END]

even,in,heavy,boots,his,feet,seemed,to,glide,soundlessly,over,the,ground,[END]
a,round,scarred,face,and,a,stubble,of,dark,beard,showed,under,his,steel,cap,and,he,wore,mail,over,boiled,leather,and,a,dirk,and,shortsword,at,his,belt,[END]

the,closing,of,the,door,behind,him,silenced,the,voices,[END]
ser,boros,blount,was,stationed,outside,the,chamber,wearing,the,long,white,cloak,and,armor,of,the,kingsguard,[END]
he,gave,ned,a,quick,curious,glance,from,the,corner,of,his,eye,but,asked,no,questions,[END]
the,day,felt,heavy,and,oppressive,as,he,crossed,the,bailey,back,to,the,tower,of,the,hand,[END]

we,may,not,have,a,fortnight,[END]
we,may,not,have,a,day,[END]
the,king,mentioned,something,about,seeing,my,head,on,a,spike,ned,frowned,[END]
he,did,not,truly,believe,the,king,would,harm,him,not,robert,[END]
he,was,angry,now,but,once,ned,was,safely,out,of,sight,his,rage,would,cool,as,it,always,did,[END]
suddenly,uncomfortably,he,found,himself,recalling,rhaegar,targaryen,[END]
fifteen,years,dead,yet,robert,hates,him,as,much,as,ever,[END]
it,was,a,disturbing,notion,and,there,was,the,other,matter,the,business,with,catelyn,and,the,dwarf,that,yoren,had,warned,him,of,last,night,[END]
that,would,come,to,light,soon,as,sure,as,sunrise,and,with,the,king,in,such,a,black,fury,robert,might,not,care,a,fig,for,tyrion,lannister,but,it,would,touch,on,his,pride,and,there,was,no,telling,what,the,queen,might,do,[END]
it,might,be,safest,if,i,went,on,ahead,he,told,poole,[END]
i,will,take,my,daughters,and,a,few,guardsmen,[END]
the,rest,of,you,can,follow,when,you,are,ready,[END]

when,he,had,gone,eddard,stark,went,to,the,window,and,sat,brooding,[END]
robert,had,left,him,no,choice,that,he,could,see,[END]
he,ought,to,thank,him,[END]
it,would,be,good,to,return,to,winterfell,[END]
he,ought,never,have,left,[END]
his,sons,were,waiting,there,[END]
perhaps,he,and,catelyn,would,make,a,new,son,together,when,he,returned,they,were,not,so,old,yet,[END]
and,of,late,he,had,often,found,himself,dreaming,of,snow,of,the,deep,quiet,of,the,wolfswood,at,night,[END]
and,yet,the,thought,of,leaving,angered,him,as,well,[END]
so,much,was,still,undone,[END]
robert,and,his,council,of,cravens,and,flatterers,would,beggar,the,realm,if,left,unchecked,or,worse,sell,it,to,the,lannisters,in,payment,of,their,loans,[END]
and,the,truth,of,jon,arryn,s,death,still,eluded,him,[END]
oh,he,had,found,a,few,pieces,enough,to,convince,him,that,jon,had,indeed,been,murdered,but,that,was,no,more,than,the,spoor,of,an,animal,on,the,forest,floor,[END]
he,had,not,sighted,the,beast,itself,yet,though,he,sensed,it,was,there,lurking,hidden,treacherous,[END]
it,struck,him,suddenly,that,he,might,return,to,winterfell,by,sea,[END]
ned,was,no,sailor,and,ordinarily,would,have,preferred,the,kingsroad,but,if,he,took,ship,he,could,stop,at,dragonstone,and,speak,with,stannis,baratheon,[END]

the,truth,he,sought,might,very,well,be,waiting,for,him,on,the,ancient,island,fortress,of,house,targaryen,[END]

some,secrets,are,safer,kept,hidden,[END]
some,secrets,are,too,dangerous,to,share,even,with,those,you,love,and,trust,[END]
ned,slid,the,dagger,that,catelyn,had,brought,him,out,of,the,sheath,on,his,belt,[END]

another,secret,or,only,a,different,strand,of,the,same,web,[END]

if,there,was,a,ship,sailing,north,on,the,morrow,it,would,be,well,to,be,on,it,[END]

varys,say,[END]

his,grace,is,most,wroth,with,you,[END]

after,you,stormed,out,it,was,left,to,me,to,convince,them,not,to,hire,the,faceless,men,he,continued,blithely,[END]
instead,varys,will,quietly,let,it,be,known,that,we,ll,make,a,lord,of,whoever,does,in,the,targaryen,girl,[END]

the,faceless,men,are,expensive,[END]
if,truth,be,told,i,did,the,targaryen,girl,more,good,than,you,with,all,your,talk,of,honor,[END]
let,some,sellsword,drunk,on,visions,of,lordship,try,to,kill,her,[END]

yet,here,he,was,with,a,scruff,of,beard,that,made,him,look,almost,a,man,[END]
perhaps,she,owed,him,something,for,having,come,this,far,[END]
very,well,she,told,him,[END]

yet,for,all,that,catelyn,misliked,the,man,[END]

do,you,have,a,name,child,[END]
mya,stone,if,it,please,you,my,lady,the,girl,said,[END]
it,did,not,please,her,it,was,an,effort,for,catelyn,to,keep,the,smile,on,her,face,[END]
stone,was,a,bastard,s,name,in,the,vale,as,snow,was,in,the,north,and,flowers,in,highgarden,in,each,of,the,seven,kingdoms,custom,had,fashioned,a,surname,for,children,born,with,no,names,of,their,own,[END]
catelyn,had,nothing,against,this,girl,but,suddenly,she,could,not,help,but,think,of,ned,s,bastard,on,the,wall,and,the,thought,made,her,angry,and,guilty,both,at,once,[END]
she,struggled,to,find,words,for,a,reply,[END]

she,has,not,failed,me,yet,[END]
then,i,put,myself,in,your,hands,mya,stone,catelyn,said,[END]
lord,nestor,i,charge,you,to,keep,a,close,guard,on,my,prisoner,[END]
and,i,charge,you,to,bring,the,prisoner,a,cup,of,wine,and,a,nicely,crisped,capon,before,he,dies,of,hunger,lannister,said,[END]
a,girl,would,be,pleasant,as,well,but,i,suppose,that,s,too,much,to,ask,of,you,the,sellsword,bronn,laughed,aloud,[END]
lord,nestor,ignored,the,banter,[END]
as,you,say,my,lady,so,it,will,be,done,only,then,did,he,look,at,the,dwarf,[END]
see,our,lord,of,lannister,to,a,tower,cell,and,bring,him,meat,and,mead,[END]
catelyn,took,her,leave,of,her,uncle,and,the,others,as,tyrion,lannister,was,led,off,then,followed,the,bastard,girl,through,the,castle,[END]
two,mules,were,waiting,in,the,upper,bailey,saddled,and,ready,[END]
mya,helped,her,mount,one,while,a,guardsman,in,a,sky-blue,cloak,opened,the,narrow,postern,gate,[END]
beyond,was,dense,forest,of,pine,and,spruce,and,the,mountain,like,a,black,wall,but,the,steps,were,there,chiseled,deep,into,the,rock,ascending,into,the,sky,[END]
some,people,find,it,easier,if,they,close,their,eyes,mya,said,as,she,led,the,mules,through,the,gate,into,the,dark,wood,[END]
when,they,get,frightened,or,dizzy,sometimes,they,hold,on,to,the,mule,too,tight,[END]
they,don,t,like,that,[END]
i,was,born,a,tully,and,wed,to,a,stark,catelyn,said,[END]
i,do,not,frighten,easily,[END]
do,you,plan,to,light,a,torch,the,steps,were,black,as,pitch,[END]
the,girl,made,a,face,[END]
torches,just,blind,you,[END]
on,a,clear,night,like,this,the,moon,and,the,stars,are,enough,[END]
mychel,says,i,have,the,eyes,of,the,owl,she,mounted,and,urged,her,mule,up,the,first,step,[END]
catelyn,s,animal,followed,of,its,own,accord,[END]
you,mentioned,mychel,before,catelyn,said,[END]
the,mules,set,the,pace,slow,but,steady,[END]
she,was,perfectly,content,with,that,[END]
mychel,s,my,love,mya,explained,[END]
mychel,redfort,[END]
he,s,squire,to,ser,lyn,corbray,[END]
we,re,to,wed,as,soon,as,he,becomes,a,knight,next,year,or,the,year,after,[END]
she,sounded,so,like,sansa,so,happy,and,innocent,with,her,dreams,[END]
catelyn,smiled,but,the,smile,was,tinged,with,sadness,[END]
the,redforts,were,an,old,name,in,the,vale,she,knew,with,the,blood,of,the,first,men,in,their,veins,[END]
his,love,she,might,be,but,no,redfort,would,ever,wed,a,bastard,[END]
his,family,would,arrange,a,more,suitable,match,for,him,to,a,corbray,or,a,waynwood,or,a,royce,or,perhaps,a,daughter,of,some,greater,house,outside,the,vale,[END]
if,mychel,redfort,laid,with,this,girl,at,all,it,would,be,on,the,wrong,side,of,the,sheet,[END]
the,ascent,was,easier,than,catelyn,had,dared,hope,[END]
the,trees,pressed,close,leaning,over,the,path,to,make,a,rustling,green,roof,that,shut,out,even,the,moon,so,it,seemed,as,though,they,were,moving,up,a,long,black,tunnel,[END]
but,the,mules,were,surefooted,and,tireless,and,mya,stone,did,indeed,seem,blessed,with,night-eyes,[END]
they,plodded,upward,winding,their,way,back,and,forth,across,the,face,of,the,mountain,as,the,steps,twisted,and,turned,[END]
a,thick,layer,of,fallen,needles,carpeted,the,path,so,the,shoes,of,their,mules,made,only,the,softest,sound,on,the,rock,[END]
the,quiet,soothed,her,and,the,gentle,rocking,motion,set,catelyn,to,swaying,in,her,saddle,[END]
before,long,she,was,fighting,sleep,[END]
perhaps,she,did,doze,for,a,moment,for,suddenly,a,massive,ironbound,gate,was,looming,before,them,[END]
stone,mya,announced,cheerily,dismounting,[END]
iron,spikes,were,set,along,the,tops,of,formidable,stone,walls,and,two,fat,round,towers,overtopped,the,keep,[END]
the,gate,swung,open,at,mya,s,shout,[END]
inside,the,portly,knight,who,commanded,the,waycastle,greeted,mya,by,name,and,offered,them,skewers,of,charred,meat,and,onions,still,hot,from,the,spit,[END]
catelyn,had,not,realized,how,hungry,she,was,[END]
she,ate,standing,in,the,yard,as,stablehands,moved,their,saddles,to,fresh,mules,[END]
the,hot,juices,ran,down,her,chin,and,dripped,onto,her,cloak,but,she,was,too,famished,to,care,[END]
then,it,was,up,onto,a,new,mule,and,out,again,into,the,starlight,[END]
the,second,part,of,the,ascent,seemed,more,treacherous,to,catelyn,[END]
the,trail,was,steeper,the,steps,more,worn,and,here,and,there,littered,with,pebbles,and,broken,stone,[END]
mya,had,to,dismount,a,half-dozen,times,to,move,fallen,rocks,from,their,path,[END]
you,don,t,want,your,mule,to,break,a,leg,up,here,she,said,[END]
catelyn,was,forced,to,agree,[END]
she,could,feel,the,altitude,more,now,[END]
the,trees,were,sparser,up,here,and,the,wind,blew,more,vigorously,sharp,gusts,that,tugged,at,her,clothing,and,pushed,her,hair,into,her,eyes,[END]
from,time,to,time,the,steps,doubled,back,on,themselves,and,she,could,see,stone,below,them,and,the,gates,of,the,moon,farther,down,its,torches,no,brighter,than,candles,[END]
snow,was,smaller,than,stone,a,single,fortified,tower,and,a,timber,keep,and,stable,hidden,behind,a,low,wall,of,unmortared,rock,[END]
yet,it,nestled,against,the,giant,s,lance,in,such,a,way,as,to,command,the,entire,stone,stair,above,the,lower,waycastle,[END]
an,enemy,intent,on,the,eyrie,would,have,to,fight,his,way,from,stone,step,by,step,while,rocks,and,arrows,rained,down,from,snow,above,[END]
the,commander,an,anxious,young,knight,with,a,pockmarked,face,offered,bread,and,cheese,and,the,chance,to,warm,themselves,before,his,fire,but,mya,declined,[END]
we,ought,to,keep,going,my,lady,she,said,[END]
if,it,please,you,catelyn,nodded,[END]
again,they,were,given,fresh,mules,[END]
hers,was,white,[END]
mya,smiled,when,she,saw,him,[END]
whitey,s,a,good,one,my,lady,[END]
sure,of,foot,even,on,ice,but,you,need,to,be,careful,[END]
he,ll,kick,if,he,doesn,t,like,you,[END]
the,white,mule,seemed,to,like,catelyn,there,was,no,kicking,thank,the,gods,[END]
there,was,no,ice,either,and,she,was,grateful,for,that,as,well,[END]
my,mother,says,that,hundreds,of,years,ago,this,was,where,the,snow,began,mya,told,her,[END]
it,was,always,white,above,here,and,the,ice,never,melted,she,shrugged,[END]
i,can,t,remember,ever,seeing,snow,this,far,down,the,mountain,but,maybe,it,was,that,way,once,in,the,olden,times,[END]
so,young,catelyn,thought,trying,to,remember,if,she,had,ever,been,like,that,[END]
the,girl,had,lived,half,her,life,in,summer,and,that,was,all,she,knew,[END]
winter,is,coming,child,she,wanted,to,tell,her,[END]
the,words,were,on,her,lips,she,almost,said,them,[END]
perhaps,she,was,becoming,a,stark,at,last,[END]
above,snow,the,wind,was,a,living,thing,howling,around,them,like,a,wolf,in,the,waste,then,falling,off,to,nothing,as,if,to,lure,them,into,complacency,[END]
the,stars,seemed,brighter,up,here,so,close,that,she,could,almost,touch,them,and,the,horned,moon,was,huge,in,the,clear,black,sky,[END]
as,they,climbed,catelyn,found,it,was,better,to,look,up,than,down,[END]
the,steps,were,cracked,and,broken,from,centuries,of,freeze,and,thaw,and,the,tread,of,countless,mules,and,even,in,the,dark,the,heights,put,her,heart,in,her,throat,[END]
when,they,came,to,a,high,saddle,between,two,spires,of,rock,mya,dismounted,[END]
it,s,best,to,lead,the,mules,over,she,said,[END]
the,wind,can,be,a,little,scary,here,my,lady,[END]
catelyn,climbed,stiffly,from,the,shadows,and,looked,at,the,path,ahead,twenty,feet,long,and,close,to,three,feet,wide,but,with,a,precipitous,drop,to,either,side,[END]
she,could,hear,the,wind,shrieking,[END]
mya,stepped,lightly,out,her,mule,following,as,calmly,as,if,they,were,crossing,a,bailey,[END]
it,was,her,turn,[END]
yet,no,sooner,had,she,taken,her,first,step,than,fear,caught,catelyn,in,its,jaws,[END]
she,could,feel,the,emptiness,the,vast,black,gulfs,of,air,that,yawned,around,her,[END]
she,stopped,trembling,afraid,to,move,[END]
the,wind,screamed,at,her,and,wrenched,at,her,cloak,trying,to,pull,her,over,the,edge,[END]
catelyn,edged,her,foot,backward,the,most,timid,of,steps,but,the,mule,was,behind,her,and,she,could,not,retreat,[END]
i,am,going,to,die,here,she,thought,[END]
she,could,feel,cold,sweat,trickling,down,her,back,[END]
lady,stark,mya,called,across,the,gulf,[END]
the,girl,sounded,a,thousand,leagues,away,[END]
are,you,well,[END]
catelyn,tully,stark,swallowed,what,remained,of,her,pride,[END]
i,i,cannot,do,this,child,she,called,out,[END]
yes,you,can,the,bastard,girl,said,[END]
i,know,you,can,[END]
look,how,wide,the,path,is,[END]
i,don,t,want,to,look,the,world,seemed,to,be,spinning,around,her,mountain,and,sky,and,mules,whirling,like,a,child,s,top,[END]
catelyn,closed,her,eyes,to,steady,her,ragged,breathing,[END]
i,ll,come,back,for,you,mya,said,[END]
don,t,move,my,lady,[END]
moving,was,about,the,last,thing,catelyn,was,about,to,do,[END]
she,listened,to,the,skirling,of,the,wind,and,the,scuffling,sound,of,leather,on,stone,[END]
then,mya,was,there,taking,her,gently,by,the,arm,[END]
keep,your,eyes,closed,if,you,like,[END]
let,go,of,the,rope,now,whitey,will,take,care,of,himself,[END]
very,good,my,lady,[END]
i,ll,lead,you,over,it,s,easy,you,ll,see,[END]
give,me,a,step,now,[END]
that,s,it,move,your,foot,just,slide,it,forward,[END]
see,[END]
now,another,[END]
easy,[END]
you,could,run,across,[END]
another,one,go,on,[END]
yes,and,so,foot,by,foot,step,by,step,the,bastard,girl,led,catelyn,across,blind,and,trembling,while,the,white,mule,followed,placidly,behind,them,[END]
the,waycastle,called,sky,was,no,more,than,a,high,crescent-shaped,wall,of,unmortared,stone,raised,against,the,side,of,the,mountain,but,even,the,topless,towers,of,valyria,could,not,have,looked,more,beautiful,to,catelyn,stark,[END]
here,at,last,the,snow,crown,began,sky,s,weathered,stones,were,rimed,with,frost,and,long,spears,of,ice,hung,from,the,slopes,above,[END]
dawn,was,breaking,in,the,east,as,mya,stone,hallooed,for,the,guards,and,the,gates,opened,before,them,[END]
inside,the,walls,there,was,only,a,series,of,ramps,and,a,great,tumble,of,boulders,and,stones,of,all,sizes,[END]
no,doubt,it,would,be,the,easiest,thing,in,the,world,to,begin,an,avalanche,from,here,[END]
a,mouth,yawned,in,the,rock,face,in,front,of,them,[END]
the,stables,and,barracks,are,in,there,mya,said,[END]
the,last,part,is,inside,the,mountain,[END]
it,can,be,a,little,dark,but,at,least,you,re,out,of,the,wind,[END]
this,is,as,far,as,the,mules,can,go,[END]
past,here,well,it,s,a,sort,of,chimney,more,like,a,stone,ladder,than,proper,steps,but,it,s,not,too,bad,[END]
another,hour,and,we,ll,be,there,[END]
catelyn,looked,up,[END]
directly,overhead,pale,in,the,dawn,light,she,could,see,the,foundations,of,the,eyrie,[END]
it,could,not,be,more,than,six,hundred,feet,above,them,[END]
from,below,it,looked,like,a,small,white,honeycomb,[END]
she,remembered,what,her,uncle,had,said,of,baskets,and,winches,[END]
the,lannisters,may,have,their,pride,she,told,mya,but,the,tullys,are,born,with,better,sense,[END]
i,have,ridden,all,day,and,the,best,part,of,a,night,[END]
tell,them,to,lower,a,basket,[END]
i,shall,ride,with,the,turnips,[END]
the,sun,was,well,above,the,mountains,by,the,time,catelyn,stark,finally,reached,the,eyrie,[END]
a,stocky,silver-haired,man,in,a,sky-blue,cloak,and,hammered,moon-and-falcon,breastplate,helped,her,from,the,basket,ser,vardis,egen,captain,of,jon,arryn,s,household,guard,[END]
beside,him,stood,maester,colemon,thin,and,nervous,with,too,little,hair,and,too,much,neck,[END]
lady,stark,ser,vardis,said,the,pleasure,is,as,great,as,it,is,unanticipated,maester,colemon,bobbed,his,head,in,agreement,[END]
indeed,it,is,my,lady,indeed,it,is,[END]
i,have,sent,word,to,your,sister,[END]
she,left,orders,to,be,awakened,the,instant,you,arrived,[END]
i,hope,she,had,a,good,night,s,rest,catelyn,said,with,a,certain,bite,in,her,tone,that,seemed,to,go,unnoticed,[END]
the,men,escorted,her,from,the,winch,room,up,a,spiral,stair,[END]
the,eyrie,was,a,small,castle,by,the,standards,of,the,great,houses,seven,slender,white,towers,bunched,as,tightly,as,arrows,in,a,quiver,on,a,shoulder,of,the,great,mountain,[END]
it,had,no,need,of,stables,nor,smithys,nor,kennels,but,ned,said,its,granary,was,as,large,as,winterfell,s,and,its,towers,could,house,five,hundred,men,[END]
yet,it,seemed,strangely,deserted,to,catelyn,as,she,passed,through,it,its,pale,stone,halls,echoing,and,empty,[END]
lysa,was,waiting,alone,in,her,solar,still,clad,in,her,bed,robes,[END]
her,long,auburn,hair,tumbled,unbound,across,bare,white,shoulders,and,down,her,back,[END]
a,maid,stood,behind,her,brushing,out,the,night,s,tangles,but,when,catelyn,entered,her,sister,rose,to,her,feet,smiling,[END]
cat,she,said,[END]
oh,cat,how,good,it,is,to,see,you,[END]
my,sweet,sister,she,ran,across,the,chamber,and,wrapped,her,sister,in,her,arms,[END]
how,long,it,has,been,lysa,murmured,against,her,[END]
oh,how,very,very,long,[END]
it,had,been,five,years,in,truth,five,cruel,years,for,lysa,[END]
they,had,taken,their,toll,[END]
her,sister,was,two,years,the,younger,yet,she,looked,older,now,[END]
shorter,than,catelyn,lysa,had,grown,thick,of,body,pale,and,puffy,of,face,[END]
she,had,the,blue,eyes,of,the,tullys,but,hers,were,pale,and,watery,never,still,[END]
her,small,mouth,had,turned,petulant,[END]
as,catelyn,held,her,she,remembered,the,slender,high-breasted,girl,who,d,waited,beside,her,that,day,in,the,sept,at,riverrun,[END]
how,lovely,and,full,of,hope,she,had,been,[END]
all,that,remained,of,her,sister,s,beauty,was,the,great,fall,of,thick,auburn,hair,that,cascaded,to,her,waist,[END]
you,look,well,catelyn,lied,but,tired,[END]
her,sister,broke,the,embrace,[END]
tired,[END]
yes,[END]
oh,yes,she,seemed,to,notice,the,others,then,her,maid,maester,colemon,ser,vardis,[END]
leave,us,she,told,them,[END]
i,wish,to,speak,to,my,sister,alone,she,held,catelyn,s,hand,as,they,withdrew,[END]
and,dropped,it,the,instant,the,door,closed,[END]
catelyn,saw,her,face,change,[END]
it,was,as,if,the,sun,had,gone,behind,a,cloud,[END]
have,you,taken,leave,of,your,senses,lysa,snapped,at,her,[END]
to,bring,him,here,without,a,word,of,permission,without,so,much,as,a,warning,to,drag,us,into,your,quarrels,with,the,lannisters,[END]
my,quarrels,catelyn,could,scarce,believe,what,she,was,hearing,[END]
a,great,fire,burned,in,the,hearth,but,there,was,no,trace,of,warmth,in,lysa,s,voice,[END]
they,were,your,quarrels,first,sister,[END]
it,was,you,who,sent,me,that,cursed,letter,you,who,wrote,that,the,lannisters,had,murdered,your,husband,[END]
to,warn,you,so,you,could,stay,away,from,them,[END]

lysa,whirled,her,heavy,robe,swirling,around,her,[END]
robert,arryn,lord,of,the,eyrie,stood,in,the,doorway,clutching,a,ragged,cloth,doll,and,looking,at,them,with,large,eyes,[END]
he,was,a,painfully,thin,child,small,for,his,age,and,sickly,all,his,days,and,from,time,to,time,he,trembled,[END]
the,shaking,sickness,the,maesters,called,it,[END]

the,city,of,the,horselords,[END]

vaes,dothrak,was,at,once,the,largest,city,and,the,smallest,that,she,had,ever,known,[END]
she,thought,it,must,be,ten,times,as,large,as,pentos,a,vastness,without,walls,or,limits,its,broad,windswept,streets,paved,in,grass,and,mud,and,carpeted,with,wildflowers,[END]
in,the,free,cities,of,the,west,towers,and,manses,and,hovels,and,bridges,and,shops,and,halls,all,crowded,in,on,one,another,but,vaes,dothrak,sprawled,languorously,baking,in,the,warm,sun,ancient,arrogant,and,empty,[END]
even,the,buildings,were,so,queer,to,her,eyes,[END]
she,saw,carved,stone,pavilions,manses,of,woven,grass,as,large,as,castles,rickety,wooden,towers,stepped,pyramids,faced,with,marble,log,halls,open,to,the,sky,[END]
in,place,of,walls,some,palaces,were,surrounded,by,thorny,hedges,[END]
none,of,them,are,alike,she,said,[END]
your,brother,had,part,of,the,truth,ser,jorah,admitted,[END]
the,dothraki,do,not,build,[END]
a,thousand,years,ago,to,make,a,house,they,would,dig,a,hole,in,the,earth,and,cover,it,with,a,woven,grass,roof,[END]
the,buildings,you,see,were,made,by,slaves,brought,here,from,lands,they,ve,plundered,and,they,built,each,after,the,fashion,of,their,own,peoples,[END]
most,of,the,halls,even,the,largest,seemed,deserted,[END]
where,are,the,people,who,live,here,dany,asked,[END]
the,bazaar,had,been,full,of,running,children,and,men,shouting,but,elsewhere,she,had,seen,only,a,few,eunuchs,going,about,their,business,[END]
only,the,crones,of,the,dosh,khaleen,dwell,permanently,in,the,sacred,city,them,and,their,slaves,and,servants,ser,jorah,replied,yet,vaes,dothrak,is,large,enough,to,house,every,man,of,every,khalasar,should,all,the,khals,return,to,the,mother,at,once,[END]
the,crones,have,prophesied,that,one,day,that,will,come,to,pass,and,so,vaes,dothrak,must,be,ready,to,embrace,all,its,children,[END]
khal,drogo,finally,called,a,halt,near,the,eastern,market,where,the,caravans,from,yi,ti,and,asshai,and,the,shadow,lands,came,to,trade,with,the,mother,of,mountains,looming,overhead,[END]
dany,smiled,as,she,recalled,magister,illyrio,s,slave,girl,and,her,talk,of,a,palace,with,two,hundred,rooms,and,doors,of,solid,silver,[END]
the,palace,was,a,cavernous,wooden,feasting,hall,its,rough-hewn,timbered,walls,rising,forty,feet,its,roof,sewn,silk,a,vast,billowing,tent,that,could,be,raised,to,keep,out,the,rare,rains,or,lowered,to,admit,the,endless,sky,[END]
around,the,hall,were,broad,grassy,horse,yards,fenced,with,high,hedges,firepits,and,hundreds,of,round,earthen,houses,that,bulged,from,the,ground,like,miniature,hills,covered,with,grass,[END]
a,small,army,of,slaves,had,gone,ahead,to,prepare,for,khal,drogo,s,arrival,[END]
as,each,rider,swung,down,from,his,saddle,he,unbelted,his,arakh,and,handed,it,to,a,waiting,slave,and,any,other,weapons,he,carried,as,well,[END]
even,khal,drogo,himself,was,not,exempt,[END]
ser,jorah,had,explained,that,it,was,forbidden,to,carry,a,blade,in,vaes,dothrak,or,to,shed,a,free,man,s,blood,[END]
even,warring,khalasars,put,aside,their,feuds,and,shared,meat,and,mead,together,when,they,were,in,sight,of,the,mother,of,mountains,[END]
in,this,place,the,crones,of,the,dosh,khaleen,had,decreed,all,dothraki,were,one,blood,one,khalasar,one,herd,[END]
cohollo,came,to,dany,as,irri,and,jhiqui,were,helping,her,down,off,her,silver,[END]
he,was,the,oldest,of,drogo,s,three,bloodriders,a,squat,bald,man,with,a,crooked,nose,and,a,mouth,full,of,broken,teeth,shattered,by,a,mace,twenty,years,before,when,he,saved,the,young,khalakka,from,sellswords,who,hoped,to,sell,him,to,his,father,s,enemies,[END]
his,life,had,been,bound,to,drogo,s,the,day,her,lord,husband,was,born,[END]
every,khal,had,his,bloodriders,[END]
at,first,dany,had,thought,of,them,as,a,kind,of,dothraki,kingsguard,sworn,to,protect,their,lord,but,it,went,further,than,that,[END]
jhiqui,had,taught,her,that,a,bloodrider,was,more,than,a,guard,they,were,the,khal,s,brothers,his,shadows,his,fiercest,friends,[END]
blood,of,my,blood,drogo,called,them,and,so,it,was,they,shared,a,single,life,[END]
the,ancient,traditions,of,the,horselords,demanded,that,when,the,khal,died,his,bloodriders,died,with,him,to,ride,at,his,side,in,the,night,lands,[END]
if,the,khal,died,at,the,hands,of,some,enemy,they,lived,only,long,enough,to,avenge,him,and,then,followed,him,joyfully,into,the,grave,[END]
in,some,khalasars,jhiqui,said,the,bloodriders,shared,the,khal,s,wine,his,tent,and,even,his,wives,though,never,his,horses,[END]
a,man,s,mount,was,his,own,[END]
daenerys,was,glad,that,khal,drogo,did,not,hold,to,those,ancient,ways,[END]
she,should,not,have,liked,being,shared,[END]
and,while,old,cohollo,treated,her,kindly,enough,the,others,frightened,her,haggo,huge,and,silent,often,glowered,as,if,he,had,forgotten,who,she,was,and,qotho,had,cruel,eyes,and,quick,hands,that,liked,to,hurt,[END]
he,left,bruises,on,doreah,s,soft,white,skin,whenever,he,touched,her,and,sometimes,made,irri,sob,in,the,night,[END]
even,his,horses,seemed,to,fear,him,[END]
yet,they,were,bound,to,drogo,for,life,and,death,so,daenerys,had,no,choice,but,to,accept,them,[END]
and,sometimes,she,found,herself,wishing,her,father,had,been,protected,by,such,men,[END]
in,the,songs,the,white,knights,of,the,kingsguard,were,ever,noble,valiant,and,true,and,yet,king,aerys,had,been,murdered,by,one,of,them,the,handsome,boy,they,now,called,the,kingslayer,and,a,second,ser,barristan,the,bold,had,gone,over,to,the,usurper,[END]
she,wondered,if,all,men,were,as,false,in,the,seven,kingdoms,[END]

the,hell,of,it,was,she,was,no,doubt,right,[END]
having,seen,what,it,took,to,get,here,tyrion,could,well,imagine,how,it,would,be,for,a,knight,trying,to,fight,his,way,up,in,armor,while,stones,and,arrows,poured,down,from,above,and,enemies,contested,with,him,for,every,step,[END]

for,an,instant,he,feared,she,would,strike,him,but,instead,she,commanded,them,to,release,him,[END]
her,men,shoved,him,to,the,floor,his,legs,went,out,from,under,him,and,tyrion,fell,[END]
he,must,have,made,quite,a,sight,as,he,struggled,to,his,knees,only,to,feel,his,right,leg,spasm,sending,him,sprawling,once,more,[END]

a,rest,in,one,of,our,sky,cells,will,do,him,much,good,[END]
the,guardsmen,jerked,him,upright,[END]
tyrion,lannister,dangled,between,them,kicking,feebly,his,face,red,with,shame,[END]
i,will,remember,this,he,told,them,all,as,they,carried,him,off,[END]
and,so,he,did,for,all,the,good,it,did,him,[END]
at,first,he,had,consoled,himself,that,this,imprisonment,could,not,last,long,[END]
lysa,arryn,wanted,to,humble,him,that,was,all,[END]
she,would,send,for,him,again,and,soon,[END]
if,not,her,then,catelyn,stark,would,want,to,question,him,[END]
this,time,he,would,guard,his,tongue,more,closely,[END]
they,dare,not,kill,him,out,of,hand,he,was,still,a,lannister,of,casterly,rock,and,if,they,shed,his,blood,it,would,mean,war,[END]
or,so,he,had,told,himself,[END]
now,he,was,not,so,certain,[END]
perhaps,his,captors,only,meant,to,let,him,rot,here,but,he,feared,he,did,not,have,the,strength,to,rot,for,long,[END]
he,was,growing,weaker,every,day,and,it,was,only,a,matter,of,time,until,mord,s,kicks,and,blows,did,him,serious,harm,provided,the,gaoler,did,not,starve,him,to,death,first,[END]
a,few,more,nights,of,cold,and,hunger,and,the,blue,would,start,calling,to,him,too,[END]
he,wondered,what,was,happening,beyond,the,walls,such,as,they,were,of,his,cell,[END]
lord,tywin,would,surely,have,sent,out,riders,when,the,word,reached,him,[END]
jaime,might,be,leading,a,host,through,the,mountains,of,the,moon,even,now,unless,he,was,riding,north,against,winterfell,instead,[END]
did,anyone,outside,the,vale,even,suspect,where,catelyn,stark,had,taken,him,[END]
he,wondered,what,cersei,would,do,when,she,heard,[END]
the,king,could,order,him,freed,but,would,robert,listen,to,his,queen,or,his,hand,[END]
tyrion,had,no,illusions,about,the,king,s,love,for,his,sister,[END]
if,cersei,kept,her,wits,about,her,she,would,insist,the,king,sit,in,judgment,of,tyrion,himself,[END]
even,ned,stark,could,scarcely,object,to,that,not,without,impugning,the,honor,of,the,king,[END]
and,tyrion,would,be,only,too,glad,to,take,his,chances,in,a,trial,[END]
whatever,murders,they,might,lay,at,his,door,the,starks,had,no,proof,of,anything,so,far,as,he,could,see,[END]
let,them,make,their,case,before,the,iron,throne,and,the,lords,of,the,land,[END]
it,would,be,the,end,of,them,[END]
if,only,cersei,were,clever,enough,to,see,that,[END]
tyrion,lannister,sighed,[END]
his,sister,was,not,without,a,certain,low,cunning,but,her,pride,blinded,her,[END]
she,would,see,the,insult,in,this,not,the,opportunity,[END]
and,jaime,was,even,worse,rash,and,headstrong,and,quick,to,anger,[END]
his,brother,never,untied,a,knot,when,he,could,slash,it,in,two,with,his,sword,[END]
he,wondered,which,of,them,had,sent,the,footpad,to,silence,the,stark,boy,and,whether,they,had,truly,conspired,at,the,death,of,lord,arryn,[END]
if,the,old,hand,had,been,murdered,it,was,deftly,and,subtly,done,[END]
men,of,his,age,died,of,sudden,illness,all,the,time,[END]
in,contrast,sending,some,oaf,with,a,stolen,knife,after,brandon,stark,struck,him,as,unbelievably,clumsy,[END]
and,wasn,t,that,peculiar,come,to,think,on,it,[END]
tyrion,shivered,[END]
now,there,was,a,nasty,suspicion,[END]
perhaps,the,direwolf,and,the,lion,were,not,the,only,beasts,in,the,woods,and,if,that,was,true,someone,was,using,him,as,a,catspaw,[END]
tyrion,lannister,hated,being,used,[END]
he,would,have,to,get,out,of,here,and,soon,[END]
his,chances,of,overpowering,mord,were,small,to,none,and,no,one,was,about,to,smuggle,him,a,six-hundred-foot-long,rope,so,he,would,have,to,talk,himself,free,[END]
his,mouth,had,gotten,him,into,this,cell,it,could,damn,well,get,him,out,[END]
tyrion,pushed,himself,to,his,feet,doing,his,best,to,ignore,the,slope,of,the,floor,beneath,him,with,its,ever-so-subtle,tug,toward,the,edge,[END]
he,hammered,on,the,door,with,a,fist,[END]
mord,he,shouted,[END]
turnkey,[END]
mord,i,want,you,he,had,to,keep,it,up,a,good,ten,minutes,before,he,heard,footsteps,[END]
tyrion,stepped,back,an,instant,before,the,door,opened,with,a,crash,[END]
making,noise,mord,growled,with,blood,in,his,eyes,[END]
dangling,from,one,meaty,hand,was,a,leather,strap,wide,and,thick,doubled,over,in,his,fist,[END]
never,show,them,you,re,afraid,tyrion,reminded,himself,[END]
how,would,you,like,to,be,rich,he,asked,[END]
mord,hit,him,[END]
he,swung,the,strap,backhand,lazily,but,the,leather,caught,tyrion,high,on,the,arm,[END]
the,force,of,it,staggered,him,and,the,pain,made,him,grit,his,teeth,[END]
no,mouth,dwarf,man,mord,warned,him,[END]
gold,tyrion,said,miming,a,smile,[END]
casterly,rock,is,full,of,gold,ahhhh,this,time,the,blow,was,a,forehand,and,mord,put,more,of,his,arm,into,the,swing,making,the,leather,crack,and,jump,[END]
it,caught,tyrion,in,the,ribs,and,dropped,him,to,his,knees,wimpering,[END]
he,forced,himself,to,look,up,at,the,gaoler,[END]
as,rich,as,the,lannisters,he,wheezed,[END]
that,s,what,they,say,mord,[END]
mord,grunted,[END]
the,strap,whistled,through,the,air,and,smashed,tyrion,full,in,the,face,[END]
the,pain,was,so,bad,he,did,not,remember,falling,but,when,he,opened,his,eyes,again,he,was,on,the,floor,of,his,cell,[END]
his,ear,was,ringing,and,his,mouth,was,full,of,blood,[END]
he,groped,for,purchase,to,push,himself,up,and,his,fingers,brushed,against,nothing,[END]
tyrion,snatched,his,hand,back,as,fast,as,if,it,had,been,scalded,and,tried,his,best,to,stop,breathing,[END]
he,had,fallen,right,on,the,edge,inches,from,the,blue,[END]
more,to,say,mord,held,the,strap,between,his,fists,and,gave,it,a,sharp,pull,[END]
the,snap,made,tyrion,jump,[END]
the,turnkey,laughed,[END]
he,won,t,push,me,over,tyrion,told,himself,desperately,as,he,crawled,away,from,the,edge,[END]
catelyn,stark,wants,me,alive,he,doesn,t,dare,kill,me,[END]
he,wiped,the,blood,off,his,lips,with,the,back,of,his,hand,grinned,and,said,that,was,a,stiff,one,mord,the,gaoler,squinted,at,him,trying,to,decide,if,he,was,being,mocked,[END]
i,could,make,good,use,of,a,strong,man,like,you,the,strap,flew,at,him,but,this,time,tyrion,was,able,to,cringe,away,from,it,[END]
he,took,a,glancing,blow,to,the,shoulder,nothing,more,[END]
gold,he,repeated,scrambling,backward,like,a,crab,more,gold,than,you,ll,see,here,in,a,lifetime,[END]
enough,to,buy,land,women,horses,you,could,be,a,lord,[END]
lord,mord,tyrion,hawked,up,a,glob,of,blood,and,phlegm,and,spat,it,out,into,the,sky,[END]
is,no,gold,mord,said,[END]
he,s,listening,[END]
tyrion,thought,[END]
they,relieved,me,of,my,purse,when,they,captured,me,but,the,gold,is,still,mine,[END]
catelyn,stark,might,take,a,man,prisoner,but,she,d,never,stoop,to,rob,him,[END]
that,wouldn,t,be,honorable,[END]
help,me,and,all,the,gold,is,yours,mord,s,strap,licked,out,but,it,was,a,halfhearted,desultory,swing,slow,and,contemptuous,[END]
tyrion,caught,the,leather,in,his,hand,and,held,it,prisoned,[END]
there,will,be,no,risk,to,you,[END]
all,you,need,do,is,deliver,a,message,[END]
the,gaoler,yanked,his,leather,strap,free,of,tyrion,s,grasp,[END]
message,he,said,as,if,he,had,never,heard,the,word,before,[END]
his,frown,made,deep,creases,in,his,brow,[END]
you,heard,me,my,lord,[END]
only,carry,my,word,to,your,lady,[END]
tell,her,what,[END]
what,would,possibly,make,lysa,arryn,relent,[END]
the,inspiration,came,to,tyrion,lannister,suddenly,[END]
tell,her,that,i,wish,to,confess,my,crimes,[END]
mord,raised,his,arm,and,tyrion,braced,himself,for,another,blow,but,the,turnkey,hesitated,[END]
suspicion,and,greed,warred,in,his,eyes,[END]
he,wanted,that,gold,yet,he,feared,a,trick,he,had,the,look,of,a,man,who,had,often,been,tricked,[END]
is,lie,he,muttered,darkly,[END]
dwarf,man,cheat,me,[END]
i,will,put,my,promise,in,writing,tyrion,vowed,[END]
some,illiterates,held,writing,in,disdain,others,seemed,to,have,a,superstitious,reverence,for,the,written,word,as,if,it,were,some,sort,of,magic,[END]
fortunately,mord,was,one,of,the,latter,[END]
the,turnkey,lowered,the,strap,[END]
writing,down,gold,[END]
much,gold,[END]
oh,much,gold,tyrion,assured,him,[END]
the,purse,is,just,a,taste,my,friend,[END]
my,brother,wears,armor,of,solid,gold,plate,in,truth,jaime,s,armor,was,gilded,steel,but,this,oaf,would,never,know,the,difference,[END]
mord,fingered,his,strap,thoughtfully,but,in,the,end,he,relented,and,went,to,fetch,paper,and,ink,[END]
when,the,letter,was,written,the,gaoler,frowned,at,it,suspiciously,[END]
now,deliver,my,message,tyrion,urged,[END]
he,was,shivering,in,his,sleep,when,they,came,for,him,late,that,night,[END]

on,your,feet,imp,[END]
my,lady,wants,to,see,you,[END]

no,doubt,she,does,but,what,makes,you,think,i,wish,to,see,her,[END]
ser,vardis,frowned,[END]

a,square,plain,face,silver,hair,a,heavy,build,and,no,humor,whatsoever,[END]
your,wishes,are,not,my,concern,[END]
on,your,feet,or,i,ll,have,you,carried,[END]
tyrion,clambered,awkwardly,to,his,feet,[END]
a,cold,night,he,said,casually,and,the,high,hall,is,so,drafty,[END]
i,don,t,wish,to,catch,a,chill,[END]

my,thanks,[END]

the,high,hall,of,the,arryns,was,aglow,with,the,light,of,fifty,torches,burning,in,the,sconces,along,the,walls,[END]
the,lady,lysa,wore,black,silk,with,the,moon-and-falcon,sewn,on,her,breast,in,pearls,[END]
since,she,did,not,look,the,sort,to,join,the,night,s,watch,tyrion,could,only,imagine,that,she,had,decided,mourning,clothes,were,appropriate,garb,for,a,confession,[END]
her,long,auburn,hair,woven,into,an,elaborate,braid,fell,across,her,left,shoulder,[END]
the,taller,throne,beside,her,was,empty,no,doubt,the,little,lord,of,the,eyrie,was,off,shaking,in,his,sleep,[END]
tyrion,was,thankful,for,that,much,at,least,[END]
he,bowed,deeply,and,took,a,moment,to,glance,around,the,hall,[END]
lady,arryn,had,summoned,her,knights,and,retainers,to,hear,his,confession,as,he,had,hoped,[END]

in,the,rear,of,the,hall,bronn,lounged,beneath,a,pillar,[END]

they,knelt,in,the,grass,beneath,the,weeping,woman,facing,each,other,with,lannister,between,them,[END]

take,care,of,the,horses,bronn,said,unsheathing,the,long,dirk,he,wore,at,his,hip,[END]
he,strode,into,the,trees,[END]
an,hour,later,the,horses,had,been,rubbed,down,and,fed,the,fire,was,crackling,away,merrily,and,a,haunch,of,a,young,goat,was,turning,above,the,flames,spitting,and,hissing,[END]

and,remember,what,i,said,this,is,only,a,taste,[END]
if,you,ever,grow,tired,of,lady,arryn,s,service,present,yourself,at,casterly,rock,and,i,ll,pay,you,the,rest,of,what,i,owe,you,with,golden,dragons,spilling,out,of,both,hands,mord,had,fallen,to,his,knees,and,promised,that,he,would,do,just,that,[END]

our,friends,are,taking,their,sweet,time,[END]

why,else,would,we,be,so,open,if,not,to,lure,them,in,[END]
tyrion,chuckled,[END]

everything,syrio,forel,had,ever,taught,her,vanished,in,a,heartbeat,[END]
in,that,instant,of,sudden,terror,the,only,lesson,arya,could,remember,was,the,one,jon,snow,had,given,her,the,very,first,[END]
she,stuck,him,with,the,pointy,end,driving,the,blade,upward,with,a,wild,hysterical,strength,[END]
needle,went,through,his,leather,jerkin,and,the,white,flesh,of,his,belly,and,came,out,between,his,shoulder,blades,[END]
the,boy,dropped,the,pitchfork,and,made,a,soft,noise,something,between,a,gasp,and,a,sigh,[END]
his,hands,closed,around,the,blade,[END]
oh,gods,he,moaned,as,his,undertunic,began,to,redden,[END]
take,it,out,[END]
when,she,took,it,out,he,died,[END]
the,horses,were,screaming,[END]
arya,stood,over,the,body,still,and,frightened,in,the,face,of,death,[END]
blood,had,gushed,from,the,boy,s,mouth,as,he,collapsed,and,more,was,seeping,from,the,slit,in,his,belly,pooling,beneath,his,body,[END]
his,palms,were,cut,where,he,d,grabbed,at,the,blade,[END]
she,backed,away,slowly,needle,red,in,her,hand,[END]
she,had,to,get,away,someplace,far,from,here,someplace,safe,away,from,the,stableboy,s,accusing,eyes,[END]
she,snatched,up,the,bridle,and,harness,again,and,ran,to,her,mare,but,as,she,lifted,the,saddle,to,the,horse,s,back,arya,realized,with,a,sudden,sick,dread,that,the,castle,gates,would,be,closed,[END]
even,the,postern,doors,would,likely,be,guarded,[END]
maybe,the,guards,wouldn,t,recognize,her,[END]
if,they,thought,she,was,a,boy,perhaps,they,d,let,her,no,they,d,have,orders,not,to,let,anyone,out,it,wouldn,t,matter,whether,they,knew,her,or,not,[END]
but,there,was,another,way,out,of,the,castle,[END]
the,saddle,slipped,from,arya,s,fingers,and,fell,to,the,dirt,with,a,thump,and,a,puff,of,dust,[END]
could,she,find,the,room,with,the,monsters,again,[END]
she,wasn,t,certain,yet,she,knew,she,had,to,try,[END]
she,found,the,clothing,she,d,gathered,and,slipped,into,the,cloak,concealing,needle,beneath,its,folds,[END]
the,rest,of,her,things,she,tied,in,a,roll,[END]
with,the,bundle,under,her,arm,she,crept,to,the,far,end,of,the,stable,[END]
unlatching,the,back,door,she,peeked,out,anxiously,[END]
she,could,hear,the,distant,sound,of,swordplay,and,the,shivery,wail,of,a,man,screaming,in,pain,across,the,bailey,[END]
she,would,need,to,go,down,the,serpentine,steps,past,the,small,kitchen,and,the,pig,yard,that,was,how,she,d,gone,last,time,chasing,the,black,tomcat,only,that,would,take,her,right,past,the,barracks,of,the,gold,cloaks,[END]
she,couldn,t,go,that,way,[END]
arya,tried,to,think,of,another,way,[END]
if,she,crossed,to,the,other,side,of,the,castle,she,could,creep,along,the,river,wall,and,through,the,little,godswood,but,first,she,d,have,to,cross,the,yard,in,the,plain,view,of,the,guards,on,the,walls,[END]
she,had,never,seen,so,many,men,on,the,walls,[END]
gold,cloaks,most,of,them,armed,with,spears,[END]
some,of,them,knew,her,by,sight,[END]
what,would,they,do,if,they,saw,her,running,across,the,yard,[END]
she,d,look,so,small,from,up,there,would,they,be,able,to,tell,who,she,was,[END]
would,they,care,[END]
she,had,to,leave,now,she,told,herself,but,when,the,moment,came,she,was,too,frightened,to,move,[END]
calm,as,still,water,a,small,voice,whispered,in,her,ear,[END]
arya,was,so,startled,she,almost,dropped,her,bundle,[END]
she,looked,around,wildly,but,there,was,no,one,in,the,stable,but,her,and,the,horses,and,the,dead,men,[END]
quiet,as,a,shadow,she,heard,[END]
was,it,her,own,voice,or,syrio,s,[END]
she,could,not,tell,yet,somehow,it,calmed,her,fears,[END]
she,stepped,out,of,the,stable,[END]
it,was,the,scariest,thing,she,d,ever,done,[END]
she,wanted,to,run,and,hide,but,she,made,herself,walk,across,the,yard,slowly,putting,one,foot,in,front,of,the,other,as,if,she,had,all,the,time,in,the,world,and,no,reason,to,be,afraid,of,anyone,[END]
she,thought,she,could,feel,their,eyes,like,bugs,crawling,on,her,skin,under,her,clothes,[END]
arya,never,looked,up,[END]
if,she,saw,them,watching,all,her,courage,would,desert,her,she,knew,and,she,would,drop,the,bundle,of,clothes,and,run,and,cry,like,a,baby,and,then,they,would,have,her,[END]
she,kept,her,gaze,on,the,ground,[END]
by,the,time,she,reached,the,shadow,of,the,royal,sept,on,the,far,side,of,the,yard,arya,was,cold,with,sweat,but,no,one,had,raised,the,hue,and,cry,[END]
the,sept,was,open,and,empty,[END]
inside,half,a,hundred,prayer,candles,burned,in,a,fragrant,silence,[END]
arya,figured,the,gods,would,never,miss,two,[END]
she,stuffed,them,up,her,sleeves,and,left,by,a,back,window,[END]
sneaking,back,to,the,alley,where,she,had,cornered,the,one-eared,tom,was,easy,but,after,that,she,got,lost,[END]
she,crawled,in,and,out,of,windows,hopped,over,walls,and,felt,her,way,through,dark,cellars,quiet,as,a,shadow,[END]
once,she,heard,a,woman,weeping,[END]
it,took,her,more,than,an,hour,to,find,the,low,narrow,window,that,slanted,down,to,the,dungeon,where,the,monsters,waited,[END]
she,tossed,her,bundle,through,and,doubled,back,to,light,her,candle,[END]
that,was,chancy,the,fire,she,d,remembered,seeing,had,burnt,down,to,embers,and,she,heard,voices,as,she,was,blowing,on,the,coals,[END]
cupping,her,fingers,around,the,flickering,candle,she,went,out,the,window,as,they,were,coming,in,the,door,without,ever,getting,a,glimpse,of,who,it,was,[END]
this,time,the,monsters,did,not,frighten,her,[END]
they,seemed,almost,old,friends,[END]
arya,held,the,candle,over,her,head,[END]
with,each,step,she,took,the,shadows,moved,against,the,walls,as,if,they,were,turning,to,watch,her,pass,[END]
dragons,she,whispered,[END]
she,slid,needle,out,from,under,her,cloak,[END]
the,slender,blade,seemed,very,small,and,the,dragons,very,big,yet,somehow,arya,felt,better,with,steel,in,her,hand,[END]
the,long,windowless,hall,beyond,the,door,was,as,black,as,she,remembered,[END]
she,held,needle,in,her,left,hand,her,sword,hand,the,candle,in,her,right,fist,[END]
hot,wax,ran,down,across,her,knuckles,[END]
the,entrance,to,the,well,had,been,to,the,left,so,arya,went,right,[END]
part,of,her,wanted,to,run,but,she,was,afraid,of,snuffing,out,her,candle,[END]
she,heard,the,faint,squeaking,of,rats,and,glimpsed,a,pair,of,tiny,glowing,eyes,on,the,edge,of,the,light,but,rats,did,not,scare,her,[END]
other,things,did,[END]
it,would,be,so,easy,to,hide,here,as,she,had,hidden,from,the,wizard,and,the,man,with,the,forked,beard,[END]
she,could,almost,see,the,stableboy,standing,against,the,wall,his,hands,curled,into,claws,with,the,blood,still,dripping,from,the,deep,gashes,in,his,palms,where,needle,had,cut,him,[END]
he,might,be,waiting,to,grab,her,as,she,passed,[END]
he,would,see,her,candle,coming,a,long,way,off,[END]
maybe,she,would,be,better,off,without,the,light,[END]
fear,cuts,deeper,than,swords,the,quiet,voice,inside,her,whispered,[END]
suddenly,arya,remembered,the,crypts,at,winterfell,[END]
they,were,a,lot,scarier,than,this,place,she,told,herself,[END]
she,d,been,just,a,little,girl,the,first,time,she,saw,them,[END]
her,brother,robb,had,taken,them,down,her,and,sansa,and,baby,bran,who,d,been,no,bigger,than,rickon,was,now,[END]
they,d,only,had,one,candle,between,them,and,bran,s,eyes,had,gotten,as,big,as,saucers,as,he,stared,at,the,stone,faces,of,the,kings,of,winter,with,their,wolves,at,their,feet,and,their,iron,swords,across,their,laps,[END]
robb,took,them,all,the,way,down,to,the,end,past,grandfather,and,brandon,and,lyanna,to,show,them,their,own,tombs,[END]
sansa,kept,looking,at,the,stubby,little,candle,anxious,that,it,might,go,out,[END]
old,nan,had,told,her,there,were,spiders,down,here,and,rats,as,big,as,dogs,[END]
robb,smiled,when,she,said,that,[END]
there,are,worse,things,than,spiders,and,rats,he,whispered,[END]
this,is,where,the,dead,walk,that,was,when,they,heard,the,sound,low,and,deep,and,shivery,[END]
baby,bran,had,clutched,at,arya,s,hand,[END]
when,the,spirit,stepped,out,of,the,open,tomb,pale,white,and,moaning,for,blood,sansa,ran,shrieking,for,the,stairs,and,bran,wrapped,himself,around,robb,s,leg,sobbing,[END]
arya,stood,her,ground,and,gave,the,spirit,a,punch,[END]
it,was,only,jon,covered,with,flour,[END]
you,stupid,she,told,him,you,scared,the,baby,but,jon,and,robb,just,laughed,and,laughed,and,pretty,soon,bran,and,arya,were,laughing,too,[END]
the,memory,made,arya,smile,and,after,that,the,darkness,held,no,more,terrors,for,her,[END]
the,stableboy,was,dead,she,d,killed,him,and,if,he,jumped,out,at,her,she,d,kill,him,again,[END]
she,was,going,home,[END]
everything,would,be,better,once,she,was,home,again,safe,behind,winterfell,s,grey,granite,walls,[END]
her,footsteps,sent,soft,echoes,hurrying,ahead,of,her,as,arya,plunged,deeper,into,the,darkness,[END]
sansa,[END]
they,came,for,sansa,on,the,third,day,[END]
she,chose,a,simple,dress,of,dark,grey,wool,plainly,cut,but,richly,embroidered,around,the,collar,and,sleeves,[END]
her,fingers,felt,thick,and,clumsy,as,she,struggled,with,the,silver,fastenings,without,the,benefit,of,servants,[END]
jeyne,poole,had,been,confined,with,her,but,jeyne,was,useless,[END]
her,face,was,puffy,from,all,her,crying,and,she,could,not,seem,to,stop,sobbing,about,her,father,[END]
i,m,certain,your,father,is,well,sansa,told,her,when,she,had,finally,gotten,the,dress,buttoned,right,[END]
i,ll,ask,the,queen,to,let,you,see,him,she,thought,that,kindness,might,lift,jeyne,s,spirits,but,the,other,girl,just,looked,at,her,with,red,swollen,eyes,and,began,to,cry,all,the,harder,[END]
she,was,such,a,child,[END]
sansa,had,wept,too,the,first,day,[END]
even,within,the,stout,walls,of,maegor,s,holdfast,with,her,door,closed,and,barred,it,was,hard,not,to,be,terrified,when,the,killing,began,[END]
she,had,grown,up,to,the,sound,of,steel,in,the,yard,and,scarcely,a,day,of,her,life,had,passed,without,hearing,the,clash,of,sword,on,sword,yet,somehow,knowing,that,the,fighting,was,real,made,all,the,difference,in,the,world,[END]
she,heard,it,as,she,had,never,heard,it,before,and,there,were,other,sounds,as,well,grunts,of,pain,angry,curses,shouts,for,help,and,the,moans,of,wounded,and,dying,men,[END]
in,the,songs,the,knights,never,screamed,nor,begged,for,mercy,[END]
so,she,wept,pleading,through,her,door,for,them,to,tell,her,what,was,happening,calling,for,her,father,for,septa,mordane,for,the,king,for,her,gallant,prince,[END]
if,the,men,guarding,her,heard,her,pleas,they,gave,no,answer,[END]
the,only,time,the,door,opened,was,late,that,night,when,they,thrust,jeyne,poole,inside,bruised,and,shaking,[END]
they,re,killing,everyone,the,steward,s,daughter,had,shrieked,at,her,[END]
she,went,on,and,on,[END]
the,hound,had,broken,down,her,door,with,a,warhammer,she,said,[END]
there,were,bodies,on,the,stair,of,the,tower,of,the,hand,and,the,steps,were,slick,with,blood,[END]
sansa,dried,her,own,tears,as,she,struggled,to,comfort,her,friend,[END]
they,went,to,sleep,in,the,same,bed,cradled,in,each,other,s,arms,like,sisters,[END]
the,second,day,was,even,worse,[END]
the,room,where,sansa,had,been,confined,was,at,the,top,of,the,highest,tower,of,maegor,s,holdfast,[END]
from,its,window,she,could,see,that,the,heavy,iron,portcullis,in,the,gatehouse,was,down,and,the,drawbridge,drawn,up,over,the,deep,dry,moat,that,separated,the,keep-within-a-keep,from,the,larger,castle,that,surrounded,it,[END]
lannister,guardsmen,prowled,the,walls,with,spears,and,crossbows,to,hand,[END]
the,fighting,was,over,and,the,silence,of,the,grave,had,settled,over,the,red,keep,[END]
the,only,sounds,were,jeyne,poole,s,endless,whimpers,and,sobs,[END]
they,were,fed,hard,cheese,and,fresh-baked,bread,and,milk,to,break,their,fast,roast,chicken,and,greens,at,midday,and,a,late,supper,of,beef,and,barley,stew,but,the,servants,who,brought,the,meals,would,not,answer,sansa,s,questions,[END]
that,evening,some,women,brought,her,clothes,from,the,tower,of,the,hand,and,some,of,jeyne,s,things,as,well,but,they,seemed,nearly,as,frightened,as,jeyne,and,when,she,tried,to,talk,to,them,they,fled,from,her,as,if,she,had,the,grey,plague,[END]
the,guards,outside,the,door,still,refused,to,let,them,leave,the,room,[END]
please,i,need,to,speak,to,the,queen,again,sansa,told,them,as,she,told,everyone,she,saw,that,day,[END]
she,ll,want,to,talk,to,me,i,know,she,will,[END]
tell,her,i,want,to,see,her,please,[END]
if,not,the,queen,then,prince,joffrey,if,you,d,be,so,kind,[END]
we,re,to,marry,when,we,re,older,[END]
at,sunset,on,the,second,day,a,great,bell,began,to,ring,[END]
its,voice,was,deep,and,sonorous,and,the,long,slow,clanging,filled,sansa,with,a,sense,of,dread,[END]
the,ringing,went,on,and,on,and,after,a,while,they,heard,other,bells,answering,from,the,great,sept,of,baelor,on,visenya,s,hill,[END]
the,sound,rumbled,across,the,city,like,thunder,warning,of,the,storm,to,come,[END]
what,is,it,jeyne,asked,covering,her,ears,[END]
why,are,they,ringing,the,bells,[END]
the,king,is,dead,sansa,could,not,say,how,she,knew,it,yet,she,did,[END]
the,slow,endless,clanging,filled,their,room,as,mournful,as,a,dirge,[END]
had,some,enemy,stormed,the,castle,and,murdered,king,robert,[END]
was,that,the,meaning,of,the,fighting,they,had,heard,[END]
she,went,to,sleep,wondering,restless,and,fearful,[END]
was,her,beautiful,joffrey,the,king,now,[END]
or,had,they,killed,him,too,[END]
she,was,afraid,for,him,and,for,her,father,[END]
if,only,they,would,tell,her,what,was,happening,[END]
that,night,sansa,dreamt,of,joffrey,on,the,throne,with,herself,seated,beside,him,in,a,gown,of,woven,gold,[END]
she,had,a,crown,on,her,head,and,everyone,she,had,ever,known,came,before,her,to,bend,the,knee,and,say,their,courtesies,[END]
the,next,morning,the,morning,of,the,third,day,ser,boros,blount,of,the,kingsguard,came,to,escort,her,to,the,queen,[END]
ser,boros,was,an,ugly,man,with,a,broad,chest,and,short,bandy,legs,[END]
his,nose,was,flat,his,cheeks,baggy,with,jowls,his,hair,grey,and,brittle,[END]
today,he,wore,white,velvet,and,his,snowy,cloak,was,fastened,with,a,lion,brooch,[END]
the,beast,had,the,soft,sheen,of,gold,and,his,eyes,were,tiny,rubies,[END]
you,look,very,handsome,and,splendid,this,morning,ser,boros,sansa,told,him,[END]
a,lady,remembered,her,courtesies,and,she,was,resolved,to,be,a,lady,no,matter,what,[END]
and,you,my,lady,ser,boros,said,in,a,flat,voice,[END]
her,grace,awaits,[END]
come,with,me,[END]
there,were,guards,outside,her,door,lannister,men-at-arms,in,crimson,cloaks,and,lion-crested,helms,[END]
sansa,made,herself,smile,at,them,pleasantly,and,bid,them,a,good,morning,as,she,passed,[END]
it,was,the,first,time,she,had,been,allowed,outside,the,chamber,since,ser,arys,oakheart,had,led,her,there,two,mornings,past,[END]
to,keep,you,safe,my,sweet,one,queen,cersei,had,told,her,[END]
joffrey,would,never,forgive,me,if,anything,happened,to,his,precious,[END]
sansa,had,expected,that,ser,boros,would,escort,her,to,the,royal,apartments,but,instead,he,led,her,out,of,maegor,s,holdfast,[END]
the,bridge,was,down,again,[END]
some,workmen,were,lowering,a,man,on,ropes,into,the,depths,of,the,dry,moat,[END]
when,sansa,peered,down,she,saw,a,body,impaled,on,the,huge,iron,spikes,below,[END]
she,averted,her,eyes,quickly,afraid,to,ask,afraid,to,look,too,long,afraid,he,might,be,someone,she,knew,[END]
they,found,queen,cersei,in,the,council,chambers,seated,at,the,head,of,a,long,table,littered,with,papers,candles,and,blocks,of,sealing,wax,[END]
the,room,was,as,splendid,as,any,that,sansa,had,ever,seen,[END]
she,stared,in,awe,at,the,carved,wooden,screen,and,the,twin,sphinxes,that,sat,beside,the,door,[END]
your,grace,ser,boros,said,when,they,were,ushered,inside,by,another,of,the,kingsguard,ser,mandon,of,the,curiously,dead,face,i,ve,brought,the,girl,[END]
sansa,had,hoped,joffrey,might,be,with,her,[END]
her,prince,was,not,there,but,three,of,the,king,s,councillors,were,[END]
lord,petyr,baelish,sat,on,the,queen,s,left,hand,grand,maester,pycelle,at,the,end,of,the,table,while,lord,varys,hovered,over,them,smelling,flowery,[END]
all,of,them,were,clad,in,black,she,realized,with,a,feeling,of,dread,[END]
mourning,clothes,[END]
the,queen,wore,a,high-collared,black,silk,gown,with,a,hundred,dark,red,rubies,sewn,into,her,bodice,covering,her,from,neck,to,bosom,[END]
they,were,cut,in,the,shape,of,teardrops,as,if,the,queen,were,weeping,blood,[END]
cersei,smiled,to,see,her,and,sansa,thought,it,was,the,sweetest,and,saddest,smile,she,had,ever,seen,[END]
sansa,my,sweet,child,she,said,i,know,you,ve,been,asking,for,me,[END]

how,can,i,allow,you,to,marry,my,son,[END]
but,i,love,him,sansa,wailed,confused,and,frightened,[END]
what,did,they,mean,to,do,to,her,[END]
what,had,they,done,to,her,father,[END]
it,was,not,supposed,to,happen,this,way,[END]
she,had,to,wed,joffrey,they,were,betrothed,he,was,promised,to,her,she,had,even,dreamed,about,it,[END]

joff,would,need,to,punish,father,the,lords,would,expect,it,but,perhaps,he,could,send,him,back,to,winterfell,or,exile,him,to,one,of,the,free,cities,across,the,narrow,sea,[END]
it,would,only,have,to,be,for,a,few,years,[END]

the,ground,under,their,horses,hooves,was,soft,and,wet,[END]

immense,blocks,of,black,basalt,each,as,large,as,a,crofter,s,cottage,lay,scattered,and,tumbled,like,a,child,s,wooden,blocks,half-sunk,in,the,soft,boggy,soil,[END]
nothing,else,remained,of,a,curtain,wall,that,had,once,stood,as,high,as,winterfell,s,[END]

the,gatehouse,tower,looked,sound,enough,and,even,boasted,a,few,feet,of,standing,wall,to,either,side,of,it,[END]
the,drunkard,s,tower,off,in,the,bog,where,the,south,and,west,walls,had,once,met,leaned,like,a,man,about,to,spew,a,bellyful,of,wine,into,the,gutter,[END]
and,the,tall,slender,children,s,tower,where,legend,said,the,children,of,the,forest,had,once,called,upon,their,nameless,gods,to,send,the,hammer,of,the,waters,had,lost,half,its,crown,[END]
it,looked,as,if,some,great,beast,had,taken,a,bite,out,of,the,crenellations,along,the,tower,top,and,spit,the,rubble,across,the,bog,[END]
all,three,towers,were,green,with,moss,[END]

the,karstark,sunburst,hung,from,the,drunkard,s,tower,beneath,the,direwolf,on,the,children,s,tower,it,was,the,greatjon,s,giant,in,shattered,chains,[END]
but,on,the,gatehouse,tower,the,stark,banner,flew,alone,[END]
that,was,where,robb,had,made,his,seat,[END]
catelyn,made,for,it,with,ser,brynden,and,ser,wendel,behind,her,their,horses,stepping,slowly,down,the,log-and-plank,road,that,had,been,laid,across,the,green-and-black,fields,of,mud,[END]
she,found,her,son,surrounded,by,his,father,s,lords,bannermen,in,a,drafty,hall,with,a,peat,fire,smoking,in,a,black,hearth,[END]
he,was,seated,at,a,massive,stone,table,a,pile,of,maps,and,papers,in,front,of,him,talking,intently,with,roose,bolton,and,the,greatjon,[END]
at,first,he,did,not,notice,her,but,his,wolf,did,[END]
the,great,grey,beast,was,lying,near,the,fire,but,when,catelyn,entered,he,lifted,his,head,and,his,golden,eyes,met,hers,[END]
the,lords,fell,silent,one,by,one,and,robb,looked,up,at,the,sudden,quiet,and,saw,her,[END]
mother,he,said,his,voice,thick,with,emotion,[END]
catelyn,wanted,to,run,to,him,to,kiss,his,sweet,brow,to,wrap,him,in,her,arms,and,hold,him,so,tightly,that,he,would,never,come,to,harm,but,here,in,front,of,his,lords,she,dared,not,[END]
he,was,playing,a,man,s,part,now,and,she,would,not,take,that,away,from,him,[END]

the,direwolf,got,to,his,feet,and,padded,across,the,room,to,where,she,stood,[END]
it,seemed,bigger,than,a,wolf,ought,to,be,[END]

you,were,fighting,with,wooden,swords,less,than,a,year,past,[END]
she,saw,anger,in,his,eyes,at,that,but,it,was,gone,as,quick,as,it,came,and,suddenly,he,was,a,boy,again,[END]
i,know,he,said,abashed,[END]

he,rose,clearly,uncomfortable,with,her,touch,and,walked,to,the,hearth,[END]
grey,wind,rubbed,his,head,against,his,leg,[END]
you,know,about,father,[END]
yes,the,reports,of,robert,s,sudden,death,and,ned,s,fall,had,frightened,catelyn,more,than,she,could,say,but,she,would,not,let,her,son,see,her,fear,[END]
lord,manderly,told,me,when,i,landed,at,white,harbor,[END]
have,you,had,any,word,of,your,sisters,[END]
there,was,a,letter,robb,said,scratching,his,direwolf,under,the,jaw,[END]
one,for,you,as,well,but,it,came,to,winterfell,with,mine,he,went,to,the,table,rummaged,among,some,maps,and,papers,and,returned,with,a,crumpled,parchment,[END]
this,is,the,one,she,wrote,me,i,never,thought,to,bring,yours,[END]
something,in,robb,s,tone,troubled,her,[END]
she,smoothed,out,the,paper,and,read,[END]
concern,gave,way,to,disbelief,then,to,anger,and,lastly,to,fear,[END]
this,is,cersei,s,letter,not,your,sister,s,she,said,when,she,was,done,[END]
the,real,message,is,in,what,sansa,does,not,say,[END]
all,this,about,how,kindly,and,gently,the,lannisters,are,treating,her,i,know,the,sound,of,a,threat,even,whispered,[END]
they,have,sansa,hostage,and,they,mean,to,keep,her,[END]
there,s,no,mention,of,arya,robb,pointed,out,miserable,[END]
no,catelyn,did,not,want,to,think,what,that,might,mean,not,now,not,here,[END]
i,had,hoped,if,you,still,held,the,imp,a,trade,of,hostages,he,took,sansa,s,letter,and,crumpled,it,in,his,fist,and,she,could,tell,from,the,way,he,did,it,that,it,was,not,the,first,time,[END]
is,there,word,from,the,eyrie,[END]
i,wrote,to,aunt,lysa,asking,help,[END]
has,she,called,lord,arryn,s,banners,do,you,know,[END]
will,the,knights,of,the,vale,come,join,us,[END]
only,one,she,said,the,best,of,them,my,uncle,but,brynden,blackfish,was,a,tully,first,[END]
my,sister,is,not,about,to,stir,beyond,her,bloody,gate,[END]
robb,took,it,hard,[END]
mother,what,are,we,going,to,do,[END]
i,brought,this,whole,army,together,eighteen,thousand,men,but,i,don,t,i,m,not,certain,he,looked,to,her,his,eyes,shining,the,proud,young,lord,melted,away,in,an,instant,and,quick,as,that,he,was,a,child,again,a,fifteen-year-old,boy,looking,to,his,mother,for,answers,[END]
it,would,not,do,[END]
what,are,you,so,afraid,of,robb,she,asked,gently,[END]
i,he,turned,his,head,away,to,hide,the,first,tear,[END]
if,we,march,even,if,we,win,the,lannisters,hold,sansa,and,father,[END]
they,ll,kill,them,won,t,they,[END]
they,want,us,to,think,so,[END]
you,mean,they,re,lying,[END]
i,do,not,know,robb,[END]
what,i,do,know,is,that,you,have,no,choice,[END]
if,you,go,to,king,s,landing,and,swear,fealty,you,will,never,be,allowed,to,leave,[END]
if,you,turn,your,tail,and,retreat,to,winterfell,your,lords,will,lose,all,respect,for,you,[END]
some,may,even,go,over,to,the,lannisters,[END]
then,the,queen,with,that,much,less,to,fear,can,do,as,she,likes,with,her,prisoners,[END]
our,best,hope,our,only,true,hope,is,that,you,can,defeat,the,foe,in,the,field,[END]
if,you,should,chance,to,take,lord,tywin,or,the,kingslayer,captive,why,then,a,trade,might,very,well,be,possible,but,that,is,not,the,heart,of,it,[END]
so,long,as,you,have,power,enough,that,they,must,fear,you,ned,and,your,sister,should,be,safe,[END]
cersei,is,wise,enough,to,know,that,she,may,need,them,to,make,her,peace,should,the,fighting,go,against,her,[END]
what,if,the,fighting,doesn,t,go,against,her,robb,asked,[END]
what,if,it,goes,against,us,[END]
catelyn,took,his,hand,[END]
robb,i,will,not,soften,the,truth,for,you,[END]
if,you,lose,there,is,no,hope,for,any,of,us,[END]
they,say,there,is,naught,but,stone,at,the,heart,of,casterly,rock,[END]
remember,the,fate,of,rhaegar,s,children,[END]
she,saw,the,fear,in,his,young,eyes,then,but,there,was,a,strength,as,well,[END]
then,i,will,not,lose,he,vowed,[END]
tell,me,what,you,know,of,the,fighting,in,the,riverlands,she,said,[END]
she,had,to,learn,if,he,was,truly,ready,[END]
less,than,a,fortnight,past,they,fought,a,battle,in,the,hills,below,the,golden,tooth,robb,said,[END]
uncle,edmure,had,sent,lord,vance,and,lord,piper,to,hold,the,pass,but,the,kingslayer,descended,on,them,and,put,them,to,flight,[END]
lord,vance,was,slain,[END]
the,last,word,we,had,was,that,lord,piper,was,falling,back,to,join,your,brother,and,his,other,bannermen,at,riverrun,with,jaime,lannister,on,his,heels,[END]
that,s,not,the,worst,of,it,though,[END]
all,the,time,they,were,battling,in,the,pass,lord,tywin,was,bringing,a,second,lannister,army,around,from,the,south,[END]
it,s,said,to,be,even,larger,than,jaime,s,host,[END]
father,must,have,known,that,because,he,sent,out,some,men,to,oppose,them,under,the,king,s,own,banner,[END]
he,gave,the,command,to,some,southron,lordling,lord,erik,or,derik,or,something,like,that,but,ser,raymun,darry,rode,with,him,and,the,letter,said,there,were,other,knights,as,well,and,a,force,of,father,s,own,guardsmen,[END]
only,it,was,a,trap,[END]
lord,derik,had,no,sooner,crossed,the,red,fork,than,the,lannisters,fell,upon,him,the,king,s,banner,be,damned,and,gregor,clegane,took,them,in,the,rear,as,they,tried,to,pull,back,across,the,mummer,s,ford,[END]
this,lord,derik,and,a,few,others,may,have,escaped,no,one,is,certain,but,ser,raymun,was,killed,and,most,of,our,men,from,winterfell,[END]
lord,tywin,has,closed,off,the,kingsroad,it,s,said,and,now,he,s,marching,north,toward,harrenhal,burning,as,he,goes,[END]
grim,and,grimmer,thought,catelyn,[END]
it,was,worse,than,she,d,imagined,[END]
you,mean,to,meet,him,here,she,asked,[END]
if,he,comes,so,far,but,no,one,thinks,he,will,robb,said,[END]
i,ve,sent,word,to,howland,reed,father,s,old,friend,at,greywater,watch,[END]
if,the,lannisters,come,up,the,neck,the,crannogmen,will,bleed,them,every,step,of,the,way,but,galbart,glover,says,lord,tywin,is,too,smart,for,that,and,roose,bolton,agrees,[END]
he,ll,stay,close,to,the,trident,they,believe,taking,the,castles,of,the,river,lords,one,by,one,until,riverrun,stands,alone,[END]
we,need,to,march,south,to,meet,him,[END]
the,very,idea,of,it,chilled,catelyn,to,the,bone,[END]
what,chance,would,a,fifteen-year-old,boy,have,against,seasoned,battle,commanders,like,jaime,and,tywin,lannister,[END]
is,that,wise,[END]
you,are,strongly,placed,here,[END]
it,s,said,that,the,old,kings,in,the,north,could,stand,at,moat,cailin,and,throw,back,hosts,ten,times,the,size,of,their,own,[END]
yes,but,our,food,and,supplies,are,running,low,and,this,is,not,land,we,can,live,off,easily,[END]
we,ve,been,waiting,for,lord,manderly,but,now,that,his,sons,have,joined,us,we,need,to,march,[END]
she,was,hearing,the,lords,bannermen,speaking,with,her,son,s,voice,she,realized,[END]
over,the,years,she,had,hosted,many,of,them,at,winterfell,and,been,welcomed,with,ned,to,their,own,hearths,and,tables,[END]
she,knew,what,sorts,of,men,they,were,each,one,[END]
she,wondered,if,robb,did,[END]
and,yet,there,was,sense,in,what,they,said,[END]
this,host,her,son,had,assembled,was,not,a,standing,army,such,as,the,free,cities,were,accustomed,to,maintain,nor,a,force,of,guardsmen,paid,in,coin,[END]
most,of,them,were,smallfolk,crofters,fieldhands,fishermen,sheepherders,the,sons,of,innkeeps,and,traders,and,tanners,leavened,with,a,smattering,of,sellswords,and,freeriders,hungry,for,plunder,[END]
when,their,lords,called,they,came,but,not,forever,[END]
marching,is,all,very,well,she,said,to,her,son,but,where,and,to,what,purpose,[END]
what,do,you,mean,to,do,[END]
robb,hesitated,[END]
the,greatjon,thinks,we,should,take,the,battle,to,lord,tywin,and,surprise,him,he,said,but,the,glovers,and,the,karstarks,feel,we,d,be,wiser,to,go,around,his,army,and,join,up,with,uncle,ser,edmure,against,the,kingslayer,he,ran,his,fingers,through,his,shaggy,mane,of,auburn,hair,looking,unhappy,[END]
though,by,the,time,we,reach,riverrun,i,m,not,certain,[END]
be,certain,catelyn,told,her,son,or,go,home,and,take,up,that,wooden,sword,again,[END]
you,cannot,afford,to,seem,indecisive,in,front,of,men,like,roose,bolton,and,rickard,karstark,[END]
make,no,mistake,robb,these,are,your,bannermen,not,your,friends,[END]
you,named,yourself,battle,commander,[END]
command,[END]
her,son,looked,at,her,startled,as,if,he,could,not,credit,what,he,was,hearing,[END]
as,you,say,mother,[END]
i,ll,ask,you,again,[END]
what,do,you,mean,to,do,[END]
robb,drew,a,map,across,the,table,a,ragged,piece,of,old,leather,covered,with,lines,of,faded,paint,[END]
one,end,curled,up,from,being,rolled,he,weighed,it,down,with,his,dagger,[END]
both,plans,have,virtues,but,look,if,we,try,to,swing,around,lord,tywin,s,host,we,take,the,risk,of,being,caught,between,him,and,the,kingslayer,and,if,we,attack,him,by,all,reports,he,has,more,men,than,i,do,and,a,lot,more,armored,horse,[END]
the,greatjon,says,that,won,t,matter,if,we,catch,him,with,his,breeches,down,but,it,seems,to,me,that,a,man,who,has,fought,as,many,battles,as,tywin,lannister,won,t,be,so,easily,surprised,[END]
good,she,said,[END]
she,could,hear,echoes,of,ned,in,his,voice,as,he,sat,there,puzzling,over,the,map,[END]
tell,me,more,[END]
i,d,leave,a,small,force,here,to,hold,moat,cailin,archers,mostly,and,march,the,rest,down,the,causeway,he,said,but,once,we,re,below,the,neck,i,d,split,our,host,in,two,[END]
the,foot,can,continue,down,the,kingsroad,while,our,horsemen,cross,the,green,fork,at,the,twins,he,pointed,[END]
when,lord,tywin,gets,word,that,we,ve,come,south,he,ll,march,north,to,engage,our,main,host,leaving,our,riders,free,to,hurry,down,the,west,bank,to,riverrun,robb,sat,back,not,quite,daring,to,smile,but,pleased,with,himself,and,hungry,for,her,praise,[END]
catelyn,frowned,down,at,the,map,[END]
you,d,put,a,river,between,the,two,parts,of,your,army,[END]
and,between,jaime,and,lord,tywin,he,said,eagerly,[END]
the,smile,came,at,last,[END]
there,s,no,crossing,on,the,green,fork,above,the,ruby,ford,where,robert,won,his,crown,[END]
not,until,the,twins,all,the,way,up,here,and,lord,frey,controls,that,bridge,[END]
he,s,your,father,s,bannerman,isn,t,that,so,[END]
the,late,lord,frey,catelyn,thought,[END]
he,is,she,admitted,but,my,father,has,never,trusted,him,[END]
nor,should,you,[END]
i,won,t,robb,promised,[END]
what,do,you,think,[END]
she,was,impressed,despite,herself,[END]
he,looks,like,a,tully,she,thought,yet,he,s,still,his,father,s,son,and,ned,taught,him,well,[END]
which,force,would,you,command,[END]
the,horse,he,answered,at,once,[END]
again,like,his,father,ned,would,always,take,the,more,dangerous,task,himself,[END]
and,the,other,[END]
the,greatjon,is,always,saying,that,we,should,smash,lord,tywin,[END]
i,thought,i,d,give,him,the,honor,[END]
it,was,his,first,misstep,but,how,to,make,him,see,it,without,wounding,his,fledgling,confidence,[END]
your,father,once,told,me,that,the,greatjon,was,as,fearless,as,any,man,he,had,ever,known,[END]
robb,grinned,[END]
grey,wind,ate,two,of,his,fingers,and,he,laughed,about,it,[END]
so,you,agree,then,[END]
your,father,is,not,fearless,catelyn,pointed,out,[END]
he,is,brave,but,that,is,very,different,[END]
her,son,considered,that,for,a,moment,[END]
the,eastern,host,will,be,all,that,stands,between,lord,tywin,and,winterfell,he,said,thoughtfully,[END]
well,them,and,whatever,few,bowmen,i,leave,here,at,the,moat,[END]

no,[END]
you,want,cold,cunning,i,should,think,not,courage,[END]
roose,bolton,robb,said,at,once,[END]
that,man,scares,me,[END]
then,let,us,pray,he,will,scare,tywin,lannister,as,well,[END]
robb,nodded,and,rolled,up,the,map,[END]
i,ll,give,the,commands,and,assemble,an,escort,to,take,you,home,to,winterfell,[END]
catelyn,had,fought,to,keep,herself,strong,for,ned,s,sake,and,for,this,stubborn,brave,son,of,theirs,[END]
she,had,put,despair,and,fear,aside,as,if,they,were,garments,she,did,not,choose,to,wear,but,now,she,saw,that,she,had,donned,them,after,all,[END]

they,were,in,a,long,line,an,endless,line,and,as,they,burst,from,the,wood,there,was,an,instant,the,smallest,part,of,a,heartbeat,when,all,catelyn,saw,was,the,moonlight,on,the,points,of,their,lances,as,if,a,thousand,willowisps,were,coming,down,the,ridge,wreathed,in,silver,flame,[END]

the,knight,s,next,cut,was,at,the,dothraki,s,ear,so,savage,that,qotho,s,face,seemed,almost,to,explode,[END]
the,dothraki,were,shouting,mirri,maz,duur,wailing,inside,the,tent,like,nothing,human,quaro,pleading,for,water,as,he,died,[END]
dany,cried,out,for,help,but,no,one,heard,[END]

aggo,s,arrow,took,him,under,the,arm,to,pierce,his,lungs,and,heart,[END]
when,at,last,daenerys,found,the,strength,to,raise,her,head,she,saw,the,crowd,dispersing,the,dothraki,stealing,silently,back,to,their,tents,and,sleeping,mats,[END]

the,sun,had,set,[END]

the,breath,went,out,of,her,it,was,all,she,could,do,to,gasp,[END]
the,sound,of,mirri,maz,duur,s,voice,was,like,a,funeral,dirge,[END]
inside,the,tent,the,shadows,whirled,[END]
an,arm,went,under,her,waist,and,then,ser,jorah,was,lifting,her,off,her,feet,[END]
his,face,was,sticky,with,blood,and,dany,saw,that,half,his,ear,was,gone,[END]

she,knew,the,answer,[END]
another,pain,grasped,her,and,dany,bit,back,a,scream,[END]

what,was,wrong,with,them,couldn,t,they,see,[END]
inside,the,tent,the,shapes,were,dancing,circling,the,brazier,and,the,bloody,bath,dark,against,the,sandsilk,and,some,did,not,look,human,[END]

the,scent,of,hot,bread,drifting,from,the,shops,along,the,street,of,flour,was,sweeter,than,any,perfume,arya,had,ever,smelled,[END]
she,took,a,deep,breath,and,stepped,closer,to,the,pigeon,[END]
it,was,a,plump,one,speckled,brown,busily,pecking,at,a,crust,that,had,fallen,between,two,cobblestones,but,when,arya,s,shadow,touched,it,it,took,to,the,air,[END]
her,stick,sword,whistled,out,and,caught,it,two,feet,off,the,ground,and,it,went,down,in,a,flurry,of,brown,feathers,[END]
she,was,on,it,in,the,blink,of,an,eye,grabbing,a,wing,as,the,pigeon,flapped,and,fluttered,[END]
it,pecked,at,her,hand,[END]
she,grabbed,its,neck,and,twisted,until,she,felt,the,bone,snap,[END]
compared,with,catching,cats,pigeons,were,easy,[END]
a,passing,septon,was,looking,at,her,askance,[END]
here,s,the,best,place,to,find,pigeon,arya,told,him,as,she,brushed,herself,off,and,picked,up,her,fallen,stick,sword,[END]
they,come,for,the,crumbs,he,hurried,away,[END]
she,tied,the,pigeon,to,her,belt,and,started,down,the,street,[END]
a,man,was,pushing,a,load,of,tarts,by,on,a,two-wheeled,cart,the,smells,sang,of,blueberries,and,lemons,and,apricots,[END]
her,stomach,made,a,hollow,rumbly,noise,[END]

three,coppers,[END]

the,others,take,your,pigeon,the,pushcart,man,said,[END]
the,tarts,were,still,warm,from,the,oven,[END]
the,smells,were,making,her,mouth,water,but,she,did,not,have,three,coppers,or,one,[END]
she,gave,the,pushcart,man,a,look,remembering,what,syrio,had,told,her,about,seeing,[END]
he,was,short,with,a,little,round,belly,and,when,he,moved,he,seemed,to,favor,his,left,leg,a,little,[END]
she,was,just,thinking,that,if,she,snatched,a,tart,and,ran,he,would,never,be,able,to,catch,her,when,he,said,you,be,keepin,your,filthy,hands,off,[END]
the,gold,cloaks,know,how,to,deal,with,thieving,little,gutter,rats,that,they,do,[END]
arya,glanced,warily,behind,her,[END]

their,cloaks,hung,almost,to,the,ground,the,heavy,wool,dyed,a,rich,gold,their,mail,and,boots,and,gloves,were,black,[END]

with,a,last,wistful,glance,at,the,tarts,arya,edged,back,from,the,cart,and,hurried,off,[END]
the,gold,cloaks,had,not,been,paying,her,any,special,attention,but,the,sight,of,them,tied,her,stomach,in,knots,[END]
arya,had,been,staying,as,far,from,the,castle,as,she,could,get,yet,even,from,a,distance,she,could,see,the,heads,rotting,atop,the,high,red,walls,[END]
flocks,of,crows,squabbled,noisily,over,each,head,thick,as,flies,[END]
the,talk,in,flea,bottom,was,that,the,gold,cloaks,had,thrown,in,with,the,lannisters,their,commander,raised,to,a,lord,with,lands,on,the,trident,and,a,seat,on,the,king,s,council,[END]
she,had,also,heard,other,things,scary,things,things,that,made,no,sense,to,her,[END]
some,said,her,father,had,murdered,king,robert,and,been,slain,in,turn,by,lord,renly,[END]
others,insisted,that,renly,had,killed,the,king,in,a,drunken,quarrel,between,brothers,[END]
why,else,should,he,have,fled,in,the,night,like,a,common,thief,[END]
one,story,said,the,king,had,been,killed,by,a,boar,while,hunting,another,that,he,d,died,eating,a,boar,stuffing,himself,so,full,that,he,d,ruptured,at,the,table,[END]
no,the,king,had,died,at,table,others,said,but,only,because,varys,the,spider,poisoned,him,[END]
no,it,had,been,the,queen,who,poisoned,him,[END]
no,he,had,died,of,a,pox,[END]
no,he,had,choked,on,a,fish,bone,[END]
one,thing,all,the,stories,agreed,on,king,robert,was,dead,[END]
the,bells,in,the,seven,towers,of,the,great,sept,of,baelor,had,tolled,for,a,day,and,a,night,the,thunder,of,their,grief,rolling,across,the,city,in,a,bronze,tide,[END]
they,only,rang,the,bells,like,that,for,the,death,of,a,king,a,tanner,s,boy,told,arya,[END]
all,she,wanted,was,to,go,home,but,leaving,king,s,landing,was,not,so,easy,as,she,had,hoped,[END]
talk,of,war,was,on,every,lip,and,gold,cloaks,were,as,thick,on,the,city,walls,as,fleas,on,well,her,for,one,[END]
she,had,been,sleeping,in,flea,bottom,on,rooftops,and,in,stables,wherever,she,could,find,a,place,to,lie,down,and,it,hadn,t,taken,her,long,to,learn,that,the,district,was,well,named,[END]
every,day,since,her,escape,from,the,red,keep,arya,had,visited,each,of,the,seven,city,gates,in,turn,[END]
the,dragon,gate,the,lion,gate,and,the,old,gate,were,closed,and,barred,[END]
the,mud,gate,and,the,gate,of,the,gods,were,open,but,only,to,those,who,wanted,to,enter,the,city,the,guards,let,no,one,out,[END]
those,who,were,allowed,to,leave,left,by,the,king,s,gate,or,the,iron,gate,but,lannister,men-at-arms,in,crimson,cloaks,and,lion-crested,helms,manned,the,guard,posts,there,[END]
spying,down,from,the,roof,of,an,inn,by,the,king,s,gate,arya,saw,them,searching,wagons,and,carriages,forcing,riders,to,open,their,saddlebags,and,questioning,everyone,who,tried,to,pass,on,foot,[END]
sometimes,she,thought,about,swimming,the,river,but,the,blackwater,rush,was,wide,and,deep,and,everyone,agreed,that,its,currents,were,wicked,and,treacherous,[END]
she,had,no,coin,to,pay,a,ferryman,or,take,passage,on,a,ship,[END]
her,lord,father,had,taught,her,never,to,steal,but,it,was,growing,harder,to,remember,why,[END]
if,she,did,not,get,out,soon,she,would,have,to,take,her,chances,with,the,gold,cloaks,[END]
she,hadn,t,gone,hungry,much,since,she,learned,to,knock,down,birds,with,her,stick,sword,but,she,feared,so,much,pigeon,was,making,her,sick,[END]
a,couple,she,d,eaten,raw,before,she,found,flea,bottom,[END]
in,the,bottom,there,were,pot-shops,along,the,alleys,where,huge,tubs,of,stew,had,been,simmering,for,years,and,you,could,trade,half,your,bird,for,a,heel,of,yesterday,s,bread,and,a,bowl,o,brown,and,they,d,even,stick,the,other,half,in,the,fire,and,crisp,it,up,for,you,so,long,as,you,plucked,the,feathers,yourself,[END]
arya,would,have,given,anything,for,a,cup,of,milk,and,a,lemon,cake,but,the,brown,wasn,t,so,bad,[END]
it,usually,had,barley,in,it,and,chunks,of,carrot,and,onion,and,turnip,and,sometimes,even,apple,with,a,film,of,grease,swimming,on,top,[END]
mostly,she,tried,not,to,think,about,the,meat,[END]
once,she,had,gotten,a,piece,of,fish,[END]
the,only,thing,was,the,pot-shops,were,never,empty,and,even,as,she,bolted,down,her,food,arya,could,feel,them,watching,[END]
some,of,them,stared,at,her,boots,or,her,cloak,and,she,knew,what,they,were,thinking,[END]
with,others,she,could,almost,feel,their,eyes,crawling,under,her,leathers,she,didn,t,know,what,they,were,thinking,and,that,scared,her,even,more,[END]
a,couple,times,she,was,followed,out,into,the,alleys,and,chased,but,so,far,no,one,had,been,able,to,catch,her,[END]
the,silver,bracelet,she,d,hoped,to,sell,had,been,stolen,her,first,night,out,of,the,castle,along,with,her,bundle,of,good,clothes,snatched,while,she,slept,in,a,burnt-out,house,off,pig,alley,[END]
all,they,left,her,was,the,cloak,she,had,been,huddled,in,the,leathers,on,her,back,her,wooden,practice,sword,and,needle,[END]
she,d,been,lying,on,top,of,needle,or,else,it,would,have,been,gone,too,it,was,worth,more,than,all,the,rest,together,[END]
since,then,arya,had,taken,to,walking,around,with,her,cloak,draped,over,her,right,arm,to,conceal,the,blade,at,her,hip,[END]
the,wooden,sword,she,carried,in,her,left,hand,out,where,everybody,could,see,it,to,scare,off,robbers,but,there,were,men,in,the,pot-shops,who,wouldn,t,have,been,scared,off,if,she,d,had,a,battle-axe,[END]
it,was,enough,to,make,her,lose,her,taste,for,pigeon,and,stale,bread,[END]
often,as,not,she,went,to,bed,hungry,rather,than,risk,the,stares,[END]
once,she,was,outside,the,city,she,would,find,berries,to,pick,or,orchards,she,might,raid,for,apples,and,cherries,[END]
arya,remembered,seeing,some,from,the,kingsroad,on,the,journey,south,[END]
and,she,could,dig,for,roots,in,the,forest,even,run,down,some,rabbits,[END]
in,the,city,the,only,things,to,run,down,were,rats,and,cats,and,scrawny,dogs,[END]
the,pot-shops,would,give,you,a,fistful,of,coppers,for,a,litter,of,pups,she,d,heard,but,she,didn,t,like,to,think,about,that,[END]
down,below,the,street,of,flour,was,a,maze,of,twisting,alleys,and,cross,streets,[END]
arya,scrambled,through,the,crowds,trying,to,put,distance,between,her,and,the,gold,cloaks,[END]
she,had,learned,to,keep,to,the,center,of,the,street,[END]
sometimes,she,had,to,dodge,wagons,and,horses,but,at,least,you,could,see,them,coming,[END]
if,you,walked,near,the,buildings,people,grabbed,you,[END]
in,some,alleys,you,couldn,t,help,but,brush,against,the,walls,the,buildings,leaned,in,so,close,they,almost,met,[END]
a,whooping,gang,of,small,children,went,running,past,chasing,a,rolling,hoop,[END]
arya,stared,at,them,with,resentment,remembering,the,times,she,d,played,at,hoops,with,bran,and,jon,and,their,baby,brother,rickon,[END]
she,wondered,how,big,rickon,had,grown,and,whether,bran,was,sad,[END]
she,would,have,given,anything,if,jon,had,been,here,to,call,her,little,sister,and,muss,her,hair,[END]
not,that,it,needed,mussing,[END]
she,d,seen,her,reflection,in,puddles,and,she,didn,t,think,hair,got,any,more,mussed,than,hers,[END]
she,had,tried,talking,to,the,children,she,saw,in,the,street,hoping,to,make,a,friend,who,would,give,her,a,place,to,sleep,but,she,must,have,talked,wrong,or,something,[END]
the,little,ones,only,looked,at,her,with,quick,wary,eyes,and,ran,away,if,she,came,too,close,[END]
their,big,brothers,and,sisters,asked,questions,arya,couldn,t,answer,called,her,names,and,tried,to,steal,from,her,[END]
only,yesterday,a,scrawny,barefoot,girl,twice,her,age,had,knocked,her,down,and,tried,to,pull,the,boots,off,her,feet,but,arya,gave,her,a,crack,on,her,ear,with,her,stick,sword,that,sent,her,off,sobbing,and,bleeding,[END]
a,gull,wheeled,overhead,as,she,made,her,way,down,the,hill,toward,flea,bottom,[END]
arya,glanced,at,it,thoughtfully,but,it,was,well,beyond,the,reach,of,her,stick,[END]
it,made,her,think,of,the,sea,[END]
maybe,that,was,the,way,out,[END]
old,nan,used,to,tell,stories,of,boys,who,stowed,away,on,trading,galleys,and,sailed,off,into,all,kinds,of,adventures,[END]
maybe,arya,could,do,that,too,[END]
she,decided,to,visit,the,riverfront,[END]
it,was,on,the,way,to,the,mud,gate,anyway,and,she,hadn,t,checked,that,one,today,[END]
the,wharfs,were,oddly,quiet,when,arya,got,there,[END]
she,spied,another,pair,of,gold,cloaks,walking,side,by,side,through,the,fish,market,but,they,never,so,much,as,looked,at,her,[END]
half,the,stalls,were,empty,and,it,seemed,to,her,that,there,were,fewer,ships,at,dock,than,she,remembered,[END]
out,on,the,blackwater,three,of,the,king,s,war,galleys,moved,in,formation,gold-painted,hulls,splitting,the,water,as,their,oars,rose,and,fell,[END]
arya,watched,them,for,a,bit,then,began,to,make,her,way,along,the,river,[END]
when,she,saw,the,guardsmen,on,the,third,pier,in,grey,woolen,cloaks,trimmed,with,white,satin,her,heart,almost,stopped,in,her,chest,[END]
the,sight,of,winterfell's,colors,brought,tears,to,her,eyes,[END]
behind,them,a,sleek,three-banked,trading,galley,rocked,at,her,moorings,[END]
arya,could,not,read,the,name,painted,on,the,hull,the,words,were,strange,myrish,braavosi,perhaps,even,high,valyrian,[END]
she,grabbed,a,passing,longshoreman,by,the,sleeve,[END]
please,she,said,what,ship,is,this,[END]
she,s,the,wind,witch,out,of,myr,the,man,said,[END]
she,s,still,here,arya,blurted,[END]
the,longshoreman,gave,her,a,queer,look,shrugged,and,walked,away,[END]
arya,ran,toward,the,pier,[END]
the,wind,witch,was,the,ship,father,had,hired,to,take,her,home,still,waiting,[END]
she,d,imagined,it,had,sailed,ages,ago,[END]
two,of,the,guardsmen,were,dicing,together,while,the,third,walked,rounds,his,hand,on,the,pommel,of,his,sword,[END]
ashamed,to,let,them,see,her,crying,like,a,baby,she,stopped,to,rub,at,her,eyes,[END]
her,eyes,her,eyes,her,eyes,why,did,[END]
look,with,your,eyes,she,heard,syrio,whisper,[END]
arya,looked,[END]
she,knew,all,of,her,father,s,men,[END]
the,three,in,the,grey,cloaks,were,strangers,[END]
you,the,one,walking,rounds,called,out,[END]
what,do,you,want,here,boy,the,other,two,looked,up,from,their,dice,[END]
it,was,all,arya,could,do,not,to,bolt,and,run,but,she,knew,that,if,she,did,they,would,be,after,her,at,once,[END]
she,made,herself,walk,closer,[END]
they,were,looking,for,a,girl,but,he,thought,she,was,a,boy,[END]
she,d,be,a,boy,then,[END]
want,to,buy,a,pigeon,she,showed,him,the,dead,bird,[END]
get,out,of,here,the,guardsman,said,[END]
arya,did,as,he,told,her,[END]
she,did,not,have,to,pretend,to,be,frightened,[END]
behind,her,the,men,went,back,to,their,dice,[END]
she,could,not,have,said,how,she,got,back,to,flea,bottom,but,she,was,breathing,hard,by,the,time,she,reached,the,narrow,crooked,unpaved,streets,between,the,hills,[END]
the,bottom,had,a,stench,to,it,a,stink,of,pigsties,and,stables,and,tanner,s,sheds,mixed,in,with,the,sour,smell,of,winesinks,and,cheap,whorehouses,[END]
arya,wound,her,way,through,the,maze,dully,[END]
it,was,not,until,she,caught,a,whiff,of,bubbling,brown,coming,through,a,pot-shop,door,that,she,realized,her,pigeon,was,gone,[END]
it,must,have,slipped,from,her,belt,as,she,ran,or,someone,had,stolen,it,and,she,d,never,noticed,[END]
for,a,moment,she,wanted,to,cry,again,[END]
she,d,have,to,walk,all,the,way,back,to,the,street,of,flour,to,find,another,one,that,plump,[END]
far,across,the,city,bells,began,to,ring,[END]
arya,glanced,up,listening,wondering,what,the,ringing,meant,this,time,[END]
what,s,this,now,a,fat,man,called,from,the,pot-shop,[END]
the,bells,again,gods,ha,mercy,wailed,an,old,woman,[END]
a,red-haired,whore,in,a,wisp,of,painted,silk,pushed,open,a,second-story,window,[END]

the,children,of,the,forest,hunted,with,that,thousands,of,years,ago,[END]
the,children,worked,no,metal,[END]
in,place,of,mail,they,wore,long,shirts,of,woven,leaves,and,bound,their,legs,in,bark,so,they,seemed,to,melt,into,the,wood,[END]
in,place,of,swords,they,carried,blades,of,obsidian,[END]

don,t,cut,yourself,[END]
tell,me,about,the,children,bran,said,[END]
it,was,important,[END]
what,do,you,wish,to,know,[END]
everything,[END]
maester,luwin,tugged,at,his,chain,collar,where,it,chafed,against,his,neck,[END]
they,were,people,of,the,dawn,age,the,very,first,before,kings,and,kingdoms,he,said,[END]
in,those,days,there,were,no,castles,or,holdfasts,no,cities,not,so,much,as,a,market,town,to,be,found,between,here,and,the,sea,of,dorne,[END]
there,were,no,men,at,all,[END]
only,the,children,of,the,forest,dwelt,in,the,lands,we,now,call,the,seven,kingdoms,[END]
they,were,a,people,dark,and,beautiful,small,of,stature,no,taller,than,children,even,when,grown,to,manhood,[END]
they,lived,in,the,depths,of,the,wood,in,caves,and,crannogs,and,secret,tree,towns,[END]
slight,as,they,were,the,children,were,quick,and,graceful,[END]
male,and,female,hunted,together,with,weirwood,bows,and,flying,snares,[END]
their,gods,were,the,gods,of,the,forest,stream,and,stone,the,old,gods,whose,names,are,secret,[END]
their,wise,men,were,called,greenseers,and,carved,strange,faces,in,the,weirwoods,to,keep,watch,on,the,woods,[END]
how,long,the,children,reigned,here,or,where,they,came,from,no,man,can,know,[END]
but,some,twelve,thousand,years,ago,the,first,men,appeared,from,the,east,crossing,the,broken,arm,of,dorne,before,it,was,broken,[END]
they,came,with,bronze,swords,and,great,leathern,shields,riding,horses,[END]
no,horse,had,ever,been,seen,on,this,side,of,the,narrow,sea,[END]
no,doubt,the,children,were,as,frightened,by,the,horses,as,the,first,men,were,by,the,faces,in,the,trees,[END]
as,the,first,men,carved,out,holdfasts,and,farms,they,cut,down,the,faces,and,gave,them,to,the,fire,[END]
horror-struck,the,children,went,to,war,[END]
the,old,songs,say,that,the,greenseers,used,dark,magics,to,make,the,seas,rise,and,sweep,away,the,land,shattering,the,arm,but,it,was,too,late,to,close,the,door,[END]
the,wars,went,on,until,the,earth,ran,red,with,blood,of,men,and,children,both,but,more,children,than,men,for,men,were,bigger,and,stronger,and,wood,and,stone,and,obsidian,make,a,poor,match,for,bronze,[END]
finally,the,wise,of,both,races,prevailed,and,the,chiefs,and,heroes,of,the,first,men,met,the,greenseers,and,wood,dancers,amidst,the,weirwood,groves,of,a,small,island,in,the,great,lake,called,gods,eye,[END]
there,they,forged,the,pact,[END]
the,first,men,were,given,the,coastlands,the,high,plains,and,bright,meadows,the,mountains,and,bogs,but,the,deep,woods,were,to,remain,forever,the,children,s,and,no,more,weirwoods,were,to,be,put,to,the,axe,anywhere,in,the,realm,[END]
so,the,gods,might,bear,witness,to,the,signing,every,tree,on,the,island,was,given,a,face,and,afterward,the,sacred,order,of,green,men,was,formed,to,keep,watch,over,the,isle,of,faces,[END]
the,pact,began,four,thousand,years,of,friendship,between,men,and,children,[END]
in,time,the,first,men,even,put,aside,the,gods,they,had,brought,with,them,and,took,up,the,worship,of,the,secret,gods,of,the,wood,[END]
the,signing,of,the,pact,ended,the,dawn,age,and,began,the,age,of,heroes,[END]
bran,s,fist,curled,around,the,shiny,black,arrowhead,[END]
but,the,children,of,the,forest,are,all,gone,now,you,said,[END]
here,they,are,said,osha,as,she,bit,off,the,end,of,the,last,bandage,with,her,teeth,[END]
north,of,the,wall,things,are,different,[END]
that,s,where,the,children,went,and,the,giants,and,the,other,old,races,[END]
maester,luwin,sighed,[END]
woman,by,rights,you,ought,to,be,dead,or,in,chains,[END]
the,starks,have,treated,you,more,gently,than,you,deserve,[END]
it,is,unkind,to,repay,them,for,their,kindness,by,filling,the,boys,heads,with,folly,[END]
tell,me,where,they,went,bran,said,[END]
i,want,to,know,[END]
me,too,rickon,echoed,[END]
oh,very,well,luwin,muttered,[END]
so,long,as,the,kingdoms,of,the,first,men,held,sway,the,pact,endured,all,through,the,age,of,heroes,and,the,long,night,and,the,birth,of,the,seven,kingdoms,yet,finally,there,came,a,time,many,centuries,later,when,other,peoples,crossed,the,narrow,sea,[END]
the,andals,were,the,first,a,race,of,tall,fair-haired,warriors,who,came,with,steel,and,fire,and,the,seven-pointed,star,of,the,new,gods,painted,on,their,chests,[END]
the,wars,lasted,hundreds,of,years,but,in,the,end,the,six,southron,kingdoms,all,fell,before,them,[END]
only,here,where,the,king,in,the,north,threw,back,every,army,that,tried,to,cross,the,neck,did,the,rule,of,the,first,men,endure,[END]
the,andals,burnt,out,the,weirwood,groves,hacked,down,the,faces,slaughtered,the,children,where,they,found,them,and,everywhere,proclaimed,the,triumph,of,the,seven,over,the,old,gods,[END]
so,the,children,fled,north,[END]
summer,began,to,howl,[END]
maester,luwin,broke,off,startled,[END]
when,shaggydog,bounded,to,his,feet,and,added,his,voice,to,his,brother,s,dread,clutched,at,bran,s,heart,[END]
it,s,coming,he,whispered,with,the,certainty,of,despair,[END]
he,had,known,it,since,last,night,he,realized,since,the,crow,had,led,him,down,into,the,crypts,to,say,farewell,[END]
he,had,known,it,but,he,had,not,believed,[END]
he,had,wanted,maester,luwin,to,be,right,[END]
the,crow,he,thought,the,three-eyed,crow,[END]
the,howling,stopped,as,suddenly,as,it,had,begun,[END]
summer,padded,across,the,tower,floor,to,shaggydog,and,began,to,lick,at,a,mat,of,bloody,fur,on,the,back,of,his,brother,s,neck,[END]
from,the,window,came,a,flutter,of,wings,[END]
a,raven,landed,on,the,grey,stone,sill,opened,its,beak,and,gave,a,harsh,raucous,rattle,of,distress,[END]
rickon,began,to,cry,[END]
his,arrowheads,fell,from,his,hand,one,by,one,and,clattered,on,the,floor,[END]
bran,pulled,him,close,and,hugged,him,[END]
maester,luwin,stared,at,the,black,bird,as,if,it,were,a,scorpion,with,feathers,[END]
he,rose,slow,as,a,sleepwalker,and,moved,to,the,window,[END]
when,he,whistled,the,raven,hopped,onto,his,bandaged,forearm,[END]
there,was,dried,blood,on,its,wings,[END]

the,dishes,piled,up,on,the,table,beneath,her,window,untouched,and,spoiling,until,the,servants,took,them,away,again,[END]
sometimes,her,sleep,was,leaden,and,dreamless,and,she,woke,from,it,more,tired,than,when,she,had,closed,her,eyes,[END]

perhaps,i,will,die,too,she,told,herself,and,the,thought,did,not,seem,so,terrible,to,her,[END]

the,serving,girls,tried,to,talk,to,her,when,they,brought,her,meals,but,she,never,answered,them,[END]

all,she,could,do,was,huddle,behind,her,door,and,listen,trembling,as,he,came,closer,and,closer,[END]
it,was,ser,ilyn,payne,she,knew,coming,for,her,with,ice,in,his,hand,coming,to,take,her,head,[END]
there,was,no,place,to,run,no,place,to,hide,no,way,to,bar,the,door,[END]
finally,the,footsteps,stopped,and,she,knew,he,was,just,outside,standing,there,silent,with,his,dead,eyes,and,his,long,pocked,face,[END]

she,crouched,down,trying,to,cover,herself,with,her,hands,as,her,door,began,to,swing,open,creaking,the,point,of,the,greatsword,poking,through,[END]

he,was,wearing,a,padded,crimson,doublet,patterned,with,lions,and,a,cloth-of-gold,cape,with,a,high,collar,that,framed,his,face,[END]
she,wondered,how,she,could,ever,have,thought,him,handsome,[END]

the,hot,water,made,her,think,of,winterfell,and,she,took,strength,from,that,[END]
she,had,not,washed,since,the,day,her,father,died,and,she,was,startled,at,how,filthy,the,water,became,[END]
her,maids,sluiced,the,blood,off,her,face,scrubbed,the,dirt,from,her,back,washed,her,hair,and,brushed,it,out,until,it,sprang,back,in,thick,auburn,curls,[END]
sansa,did,not,speak,to,them,except,to,give,them,commands,they,were,lannister,servants,not,her,own,and,she,did,not,trust,them,[END]
when,the,time,came,to,dress,she,chose,the,green,silk,gown,that,she,had,worn,to,the,tourney,[END]
she,recalled,how,gallant,joff,had,been,to,her,that,night,at,the,feast,[END]
perhaps,it,would,make,him,remember,as,well,and,treat,her,more,gently,[END]
she,drank,a,glass,of,buttermilk,and,nibbled,at,some,sweet,biscuits,as,she,waited,to,settle,her,stomach,[END]

he,felt,nothing,for,her,at,all,[END]
she,was,only,a,a,thing,to,him,[END]
no,she,said,rising,[END]
she,wanted,to,rage,to,hurt,him,as,he,d,hurt,her,to,warn,him,that,when,she,was,queen,she,would,have,him,exiled,if,he,ever,dared,strike,her,again,but,she,remembered,what,the,hound,had,told,her,so,all,she,said,was,i,shall,do,whatever,his,grace,commands,[END]
as,i,do,he,replied,[END]

sandor,clegane,would,have,laughed,at,that,sansa,knew,[END]
other,men,might,have,cursed,her,warned,her,to,keep,silent,even,begged,for,her,forgiveness,[END]
ser,meryn,trant,did,none,of,these,[END]
ser,meryn,trant,simply,did,not,care,[END]
the,balcony,was,deserted,save,for,sansa,[END]
she,stood,with,her,head,bowed,fighting,to,hold,back,her,tears,while,below,joffrey,sat,on,his,iron,throne,and,dispensed,what,it,pleased,him,to,call,justice,[END]
nine,cases,out,of,ten,seemed,to,bore,him,those,he,allowed,his,council,to,handle,squirming,restlessly,while,lord,baelish,grand,maester,pycelle,or,queen,cersei,resolved,the,matter,[END]
when,he,did,choose,to,make,a,ruling,though,not,even,his,queen,mother,could,sway,him,[END]
a,thief,was,brought,before,him,and,he,had,ser,ilyn,chop,his,hand,off,right,there,in,court,[END]

a,woman,fell,to,her,knees,to,plead,for,the,head,of,a,man,executed,as,a,traitor,[END]
she,had,loved,him,she,said,and,she,wanted,to,see,him,decently,buried,[END]

two,gold,cloaks,dragged,her,off,to,the,dungeons,[END]
frog-faced,lord,slynt,sat,at,the,end,of,the,council,table,wearing,a,black,velvet,doublet,and,a,shiny,cloth-of-gold,cape,nodding,with,approval,every,time,the,king,pronounced,a,sentence,[END]
sansa,stared,hard,at,his,ugly,face,remembering,how,he,had,thrown,down,her,father,for,ser,ilyn,to,behead,wishing,she,could,hurt,him,wishing,that,some,hero,would,throw,him,down,and,cut,off,his,head,[END]
but,a,voice,inside,her,whispered,there,are,no,heroes,and,she,remembered,what,lord,petyr,had,said,to,her,here,in,this,very,hall,[END]
life,is,not,a,song,sweetling,he,d,told,her,[END]
you,may,learn,that,one,day,to,your,sorrow,in,life,the,monsters,win,she,told,herself,and,now,it,was,the,hound,s,voice,she,heard,a,cold,rasp,metal,on,stone,[END]
save,yourself,some,pain,girl,and,give,him,what,he,wants,[END]
the,last,case,was,a,plump,tavern,singer,accused,of,making,a,song,that,ridiculed,the,late,king,robert,[END]
joff,commanded,them,to,fetch,his,woodharp,and,ordered,him,to,perform,the,song,for,the,court,[END]
the,singer,wept,and,swore,he,would,never,sing,that,song,again,but,the,king,insisted,[END]
it,was,sort,of,a,funny,song,all,about,robert,fighting,with,a,pig,[END]
the,pig,was,the,boar,who,d,killed,him,sansa,knew,but,in,some,verses,it,almost,sounded,as,if,he,were,singing,about,the,queen,[END]
when,the,song,was,done,joffrey,announced,that,he,d,decided,to,be,merciful,[END]
the,singer,could,keep,either,his,fingers,or,his,tongue,[END]
he,would,have,a,day,to,make,his,choice,[END]
janos,slynt,nodded,[END]
that,was,the,final,business,of,the,afternoon,sansa,saw,with,relief,but,her,ordeal,was,not,yet,done,[END]
when,the,herald,s,voice,dismissed,the,court,she,fled,the,balcony,only,to,find,joffrey,waiting,for,her,at,the,base,of,the,curving,stairs,[END]

he'll,have,you,up,there,no,matter,what,so,give,him,what,he,wants,[END]
she,forced,herself,to,take,king,joffrey,s,hand,[END]

yet,he,sat,there,silent,and,still,[END]
the,shards,of,the,broken,cup,crunched,beneath,his,father,s,heels,as,lord,tywin,crossed,the,room,[END]
one,last,thing,he,said,at,the,door,[END]
you,will,not,take,the,whore,to,court,[END]

finally,he,climbed,the,steps,to,his,cozy,garret,beneath,the,bell,tower,[END]
the,ceiling,was,low,but,that,was,scarcely,a,drawback,for,a,dwarf,[END]
from,the,window,he,could,see,the,gibbet,his,father,had,erected,in,the,yard,[END]

the,mare,whickered,softly,as,jon,snow,tightened,the,cinch,[END]
easy,sweet,lady,he,said,in,a,soft,voice,quieting,her,with,a,touch,[END]
wind,whispered,through,the,stable,a,cold,dead,breath,on,his,face,but,jon,paid,it,no,mind,[END]
he,strapped,his,roll,to,the,saddle,his,scarred,fingers,stiff,and,clumsy,[END]
ghost,he,called,softly,to,me,and,the,wolf,was,there,eyes,like,embers,[END]

you,must,not,do,this,[END]

for,an,instant,sam,stood,his,ground,his,face,as,round,and,pale,as,the,moon,behind,him,his,mouth,a,widening,o,of,surprise,[END]
at,the,last,moment,when,they,were,almost,on,him,he,jumped,aside,as,jon,had,known,he,would,stumbled,and,fell,[END]
the,mare,leapt,over,him,out,into,the,night,[END]
jon,raised,the,hood,of,his,heavy,cloak,and,gave,the,horse,her,head,[END]
castle,black,was,silent,and,still,as,he,rode,out,with,ghost,racing,at,his,side,[END]
men,watched,from,the,wall,behind,him,he,knew,but,their,eyes,were,turned,north,not,south,[END]
no,one,would,see,him,go,no,one,but,sam,tarly,struggling,back,to,his,feet,in,the,dust,of,the,old,stables,[END]
he,hoped,sam,hadn,t,hurt,himself,falling,like,that,[END]
he,was,so,heavy,and,so,ungainly,it,would,be,just,like,him,to,break,a,wrist,or,twist,his,ankle,getting,out,of,the,way,[END]
i,warned,him,jon,said,aloud,[END]
it,was,nothing,to,do,with,him,anyway,he,flexed,his,burned,hand,as,he,rode,opening,and,closing,the,scarred,fingers,[END]
they,still,pained,him,but,it,felt,good,to,have,the,wrappings,off,[END]
moonlight,silvered,the,hills,as,he,followed,the,twisting,ribbon,of,the,kingsroad,[END]
he,needed,to,get,as,far,from,the,wall,as,he,could,before,they,realized,he,was,gone,[END]
on,the,morrow,he,would,leave,the,road,and,strike,out,overland,through,field,and,bush,and,stream,to,throw,off,pursuit,but,for,the,moment,speed,was,more,important,than,deception,[END]
it,was,not,as,though,they,would,not,guess,where,he,was,going,[END]
the,old,bear,was,accustomed,to,rise,at,first,light,so,jon,had,until,dawn,to,put,as,many,leagues,as,he,could,between,him,and,the,wall,if,sam,tarly,did,not,betray,him,[END]
the,fat,boy,was,dutiful,and,easily,frightened,but,he,loved,jon,like,a,brother,[END]
if,questioned,sam,would,doubtless,tell,them,the,truth,but,jon,could,not,imagine,him,braving,the,guards,in,front,of,the,king,s,tower,to,wake,mormont,from,sleep,[END]
when,jon,did,not,appear,to,fetch,the,old,bear,s,breakfast,from,the,kitchen,they,d,look,in,his,cell,and,find,longclaw,on,the,bed,[END]
it,had,been,hard,to,abandon,it,but,jon,was,not,so,lost,to,honor,as,to,take,it,with,him,[END]
even,jorah,mormont,had,not,done,that,when,he,fled,in,disgrace,[END]
doubtless,lord,mormont,would,find,someone,more,worthy,of,the,blade,[END]
jon,felt,bad,when,he,thought,of,the,old,man,[END]
he,knew,his,desertion,would,be,salt,in,the,still-raw,wound,of,his,son,s,disgrace,[END]
that,seemed,a,poor,way,to,repay,him,for,his,trust,but,it,couldn,t,be,helped,[END]
no,matter,what,he,did,jon,felt,as,though,he,were,betraying,someone,[END]
even,now,he,did,not,know,if,he,was,doing,the,honorable,thing,[END]
the,southron,had,it,easier,[END]
they,had,their,septons,to,talk,to,someone,to,tell,them,the,gods,will,and,help,sort,out,right,from,wrong,[END]
but,the,starks,worshiped,the,old,gods,the,nameless,gods,and,if,the,heart,trees,heard,they,did,not,speak,[END]
when,the,last,lights,of,castle,black,vanished,behind,him,jon,slowed,his,mare,to,a,walk,[END]
he,had,a,long,journey,ahead,and,only,the,one,horse,to,see,him,through,[END]
there,were,holdfasts,and,farming,villages,along,the,road,south,where,he,might,be,able,to,trade,the,mare,for,a,fresh,mount,when,he,needed,one,but,not,if,she,were,injured,or,blown,[END]
he,would,need,to,find,new,clothes,soon,most,like,he,d,need,to,steal,them,[END]
he,was,clad,in,black,from,head,to,heel,high,leather,riding,boots,roughspun,breeches,and,tunic,sleeveless,leather,jerkin,and,heavy,wool,cloak,[END]
his,longsword,and,dagger,were,sheathed,in,black,moleskin,and,the,hauberk,and,coif,in,his,saddlebag,were,black,ringmail,[END]
any,bit,of,it,could,mean,his,death,if,he,were,taken,[END]
a,stranger,wearing,black,was,viewed,with,cold,suspicion,in,every,village,and,holdfast,north,of,the,neck,and,men,would,soon,be,watching,for,him,[END]
once,maester,aemon,s,ravens,took,flight,jon,knew,he,would,find,no,safe,haven,[END]
not,even,at,winterfell,[END]
bran,might,want,to,let,him,in,but,maester,luwin,had,better,sense,[END]
he,would,bar,the,gates,and,send,jon,away,as,he,should,[END]
better,not,to,call,there,at,all,[END]
yet,he,saw,the,castle,clear,in,his,mind,s,eye,as,if,he,had,left,it,only,yesterday,the,towering,granite,walls,the,great,hall,with,its,smells,of,smoke,and,dog,and,roasting,meat,his,father,s,solar,the,turret,room,where,he,had,slept,[END]
part,of,him,wanted,nothing,so,much,as,to,hear,bran,laugh,again,to,sup,on,one,of,gage,s,beef-and-bacon,pies,to,listen,to,old,nan,tell,her,tales,of,the,children,of,the,forest,and,florian,the,fool,[END]
but,he,had,not,left,the,wall,for,that,he,had,left,because,he,was,after,all,his,father,s,son,and,robb,s,brother,[END]
the,gift,of,a,sword,even,a,sword,as,fine,as,longclaw,did,not,make,him,a,mormont,[END]
nor,was,he,aemon,targaryen,[END]
three,times,the,old,man,had,chosen,and,three,times,he,had,chosen,honor,but,that,was,him,[END]
even,now,jon,could,not,decide,whether,the,maester,had,stayed,because,he,was,weak,and,craven,or,because,he,was,strong,and,true,[END]
yet,he,understood,what,the,old,man,had,meant,about,the,pain,of,choosing,he,understood,that,all,too,well,[END]
tyrion,lannister,had,claimed,that,most,men,would,rather,deny,a,hard,truth,than,face,it,but,jon,was,done,with,denials,[END]
he,was,who,he,was,jon,snow,bastard,and,oathbreaker,motherless,friendless,and,damned,[END]
for,the,rest,of,his,life,however,long,that,might,be,he,would,be,condemned,to,be,an,outsider,the,silent,man,standing,in,the,shadows,who,dares,not,speak,his,true,name,[END]
wherever,he,might,go,throughout,the,seven,kingdoms,he,would,need,to,live,a,lie,lest,every,man,s,hand,be,raised,against,him,[END]
but,it,made,no,matter,so,long,as,he,lived,long,enough,to,take,his,place,by,his,brother,s,side,and,help,avenge,his,father,[END]
he,remembered,robb,as,he,had,last,seen,him,standing,in,the,yard,with,snow,melting,in,his,auburn,hair,[END]
jon,would,have,to,come,to,him,in,secret,disguised,[END]
he,tried,to,imagine,the,look,on,robb,s,face,when,he,revealed,himself,[END]
his,brother,would,shake,his,head,and,smile,and,he,d,say,he,d,say,[END]
he,could,not,see,the,smile,[END]
hard,as,he,tried,he,could,not,see,it,[END]
he,found,himself,thinking,of,the,deserter,his,father,had,beheaded,the,day,they,d,found,the,direwolves,[END]
you,said,the,words,lord,eddard,had,told,him,[END]
you,took,a,vow,before,your,brothers,before,the,old,gods,and,the,new,desmond,and,fat,tom,had,dragged,the,man,to,the,stump,[END]
bran,s,eyes,had,been,wide,as,saucers,and,jon,had,to,remind,him,to,keep,his,pony,in,hand,[END]
he,remembered,the,look,on,father,s,face,when,theon,greyjoy,brought,forth,ice,the,spray,of,blood,on,the,snow,the,way,theon,had,kicked,the,head,when,it,came,rolling,at,his,feet,[END]
he,wondered,what,lord,eddard,might,have,done,if,the,deserter,had,been,his,brother,benjen,instead,of,that,ragged,stranger,[END]
would,it,have,been,any,different,[END]
it,must,surely,surely,and,robb,would,welcome,him,for,a,certainty,[END]

it,did,not,bear,thinking,about,[END]
pain,throbbed,deep,in,his,fingers,as,he,clutched,the,reins,[END]
jon,put,his,heels,into,his,horse,and,broke,into,a,gallop,racing,down,the,kingsroad,as,if,to,outrun,his,doubts,[END]

catelyn,[END]
it,seemed,a,thousand,years,ago,that,catelyn,stark,had,carried,her,infant,son,out,of,riverrun,crossing,the,tumblestone,in,a,small,boat,to,begin,their,journey,north,to,winterfell,[END]
and,it,was,across,the,tumblestone,that,they,came,home,now,though,the,boy,wore,plate,and,mail,in,place,of,swaddling,clothes,[END]
robb,sat,in,the,bow,with,grey,wind,his,hand,resting,on,his,direwolf,s,head,as,the,rowers,pulled,at,their,oars,[END]
theon,greyjoy,was,with,him,[END]
her,uncle,brynden,would,come,behind,in,the,second,boat,with,the,greatjon,and,lord,karstark,[END]
catelyn,took,a,place,toward,the,stern,[END]
they,shot,down,the,tumblestone,letting,the,strong,current,push,them,past,the,looming,wheel,tower,[END]
the,splash,and,rumble,of,the,great,waterwheel,within,was,a,sound,from,her,girlhood,that,brought,a,sad,smile,to,catelyn,s,face,[END]
from,the,sandstone,walls,of,the,castle,soldiers,and,servants,shouted,down,her,name,and,robb,s,and,winterfell,from,every,rampart,waved,the,banner,of,house,tully,a,leaping,trout,silver,against,a,rippling,blue-and-red,field,[END]
it,was,a,stirring,sight,yet,it,did,not,lift,her,heart,[END]

oh,ned,[END]
below,the,wheel,tower,they,made,a,wide,turn,and,knifed,through,the,churning,water,[END]
the,men,put,their,backs,into,it,[END]
the,wide,arch,of,the,water,gate,came,into,view,and,she,heard,the,creak,of,heavy,chains,as,the,great,iron,portcullis,was,winched,upward,[END]
it,rose,slowly,as,they,approached,and,catelyn,saw,that,the,lower,half,of,it,was,red,with,rust,[END]
the,bottom,foot,dripped,brown,mud,on,them,as,they,passed,underneath,the,barbed,spikes,mere,inches,above,their,heads,[END]
catelyn,gazed,up,at,the,bars,and,wondered,how,deep,the,rust,went,and,how,well,the,portcullis,would,stand,up,to,a,ram,and,whether,it,ought,to,be,replaced,[END]
thoughts,like,that,were,seldom,far,from,her,mind,these,days,[END]

boats,large,and,small,were,tied,up,all,around,them,secured,to,iron,rings,set,in,the,stone,[END]

when,grey,wind,bounded,out,one,of,them,dropped,his,pole,and,lurched,back,stumbling,and,sitting,down,abruptly,in,the,river,[END]
the,others,laughed,and,the,man,got,a,sheepish,look,on,his,face,[END]
