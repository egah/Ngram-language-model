when,first,he,came,to,dragonstone,the,army,of,stone,grotesques,had,made,him,uneasy,but,as,the,years,passed,he,had,grown,used,to,them,[END]
now,he,thought,of,them,as,old,friends,[END]
the,three,of,them,watched,the,sky,together,with,foreboding,[END]

omens,all,[END]
too,many,to,deny,[END]

it,is,ill,to,keep,a,lady,waiting,he,waved,a,hand,a,feeble,gesture,of,haste,from,a,man,no,longer,capable,of,hastening,[END]
his,flesh,was,wrinkled,and,spotted,the,skin,so,papery,thin,that,he,could,see,the,web,of,veins,and,the,shape,of,bones,beneath,[END]
and,how,they,trembled,these,hands,of,his,that,had,once,been,so,sure,and,deft,[END]
when,pylos,returned,the,girl,came,with,him,shy,as,ever,[END]
behind,her,shuffling,and,hopping,in,that,queer,sideways,walk,of,his,came,her,fool,[END]
on,his,head,was,a,mock,helm,fashioned,from,an,old,tin,bucket,with,a,rack,of,deer,antlers,strapped,to,the,crown,and,hung,with,cowbells,[END]

who,comes,to,see,us,so,early,pylos,cressen,said,[END]
it,s,me,and,patches,maester,guileless,blue,eyes,blinked,at,him,[END]
hers,was,not,a,pretty,face,alas,[END]
the,child,had,her,lord,father,s,square,jut,of,jaw,and,her,mother,s,unfortunate,ears,along,with,a,disfigurement,all,her,own,the,legacy,of,the,bout,of,greyscale,that,had,almost,claimed,her,in,the,crib,[END]
across,half,one,cheek,and,well,down,her,neck,her,flesh,was,stiff,and,dead,the,skin,cracked,and,flaking,mottled,black,and,grey,and,stony,to,the,touch,[END]
pylos,said,we,might,see,the,white,raven,[END]
indeed,you,may,cressen,answered,[END]
as,if,he,would,ever,deny,her,[END]
she,had,been,denied,too,often,in,her,time,[END]
her,name,was,shireen,[END]
she,would,be,ten,on,her,next,name,day,and,she,was,the,saddest,child,that,maester,cressen,had,ever,known,[END]
her,sadness,is,my,shame,the,old,man,thought,another,mark,of,my,failure,[END]
maester,pylos,do,me,a,kindness,and,bring,the,bird,down,from,the,rookery,for,the,lady,shireen,[END]
it,would,be,my,pleasure,pylos,was,a,polite,youth,no,more,than,five-and-twenty,yet,solemn,as,a,man,of,sixty,[END]
if,only,he,had,more,humor,more,life,in,him,that,was,what,was,needed,here,[END]
grim,places,needed,lightening,not,solemnity,and,dragonstone,was,grim,beyond,a,doubt,a,lonely,citadel,in,the,wet,waste,surrounded,by,storm,and,salt,with,the,smoking,shadow,of,the,mountain,at,its,back,[END]
a,maester,must,go,where,he,is,sent,so,cressen,had,come,here,with,his,lord,some,twelve,years,past,and,he,had,served,and,served,well,[END]
yet,he,had,never,loved,dragonstone,nor,ever,felt,truly,at,home,here,[END]
of,late,when,he,woke,from,restless,dreams,in,which,the,red,woman,figured,disturbingly,he,often,did,not,know,where,he,was,[END]
the,fool,turned,his,patched,and,piebald,head,to,watch,pylos,climb,the,steep,iron,steps,to,the,rookery,[END]
his,bells,rang,with,the,motion,[END]
under,the,sea,the,birds,have,scales,for,feathers,he,said,clang-a-langing,[END]
i,know,i,know,oh,oh,oh,[END]
even,for,a,fool,patchface,was,a,sorry,thing,[END]
perhaps,once,he,could,evoke,gales,of,laughter,with,a,quip,but,the,sea,had,taken,that,power,from,him,along,with,half,his,wits,and,all,his,memory,[END]
he,was,soft,and,obese,subject,to,twitches,and,trembles,incoherent,as,often,as,not,[END]
the,girl,was,the,only,one,who,laughed,at,him,now,the,only,one,who,cared,if,he,lived,or,died,[END]
an,ugly,little,girl,and,a,sad,fool,and,maester,makes,three,[END]
now,there,is,a,tale,to,make,men,weep,[END]
sit,with,me,child,cressen,beckoned,her,closer,[END]
this,is,early,to,come,calling,scarce,past,dawn,[END]
you,should,be,snug,in,your,bed,[END]
i,had,bad,dreams,shireen,told,him,[END]
about,the,dragons,[END]
they,were,coming,to,eat,me,[END]
the,child,had,been,plagued,by,nightmares,as,far,back,as,maester,cressen,could,recall,[END]
we,have,talked,of,this,before,he,said,gently,[END]
the,dragons,cannot,come,to,life,[END]
they,are,carved,of,stone,child,[END]
in,olden,days,our,island,was,the,westernmost,outpost,of,the,great,freehold,of,valyria,[END]
it,was,the,valyrians,who,raised,this,citadel,and,they,had,ways,of,shaping,stone,since,lost,to,us,[END]
a,castle,must,have,towers,wherever,two,walls,meet,at,an,angle,for,defense,[END]
the,valyrians,fashioned,these,towers,in,the,shape,of,dragons,to,make,their,fortress,seem,more,fearsome,just,as,they,crowned,their,walls,with,a,thousand,gargoyles,instead,of,simple,crenellations,he,took,her,small,pink,hand,in,his,own,frail,spotted,one,and,gave,it,a,gentle,squeeze,[END]
so,you,see,there,is,nothing,to,fear,[END]
shireen,was,unconvinced,[END]
what,about,the,thing,in,the,sky,[END]
dalla,and,matrice,were,talking,by,the,well,and,dalla,said,she,heard,the,red,woman,tell,mother,that,it,was,dragonsbreath,[END]
if,the,dragons,are,breathing,doesn,t,that,mean,they,are,coming,to,life,[END]
the,red,woman,maester,cressen,thought,sourly,[END]
ill,enough,that,she,s,filled,the,head,of,the,mother,with,her,madness,must,she,poison,the,daughter,s,dreams,as,well,[END]
he,would,have,a,stern,word,with,dalla,warn,her,not,to,spread,such,tales,[END]
the,thing,in,the,sky,is,a,comet,sweet,child,[END]
a,star,with,a,tail,lost,in,the,heavens,[END]
it,will,be,gone,soon,enough,never,to,be,seen,again,in,our,lifetimes,[END]
watch,and,see,[END]
shireen,gave,a,brave,little,nod,[END]
mother,said,the,white,raven,means,it,s,not,summer,anymore,[END]
that,is,so,my,lady,[END]
the,white,ravens,fly,only,from,the,citadel,cressen,s,fingers,went,to,the,chain,about,his,neck,each,link,forged,from,a,different,metal,each,symbolizing,his,mastery,of,another,branch,of,learning,the,maester,s,collar,mark,of,his,order,[END]
in,the,pride,of,his,youth,he,had,worn,it,easily,but,now,it,seemed,heavy,to,him,the,metal,cold,against,his,skin,[END]
they,are,larger,than,other,ravens,and,more,clever,bred,to,carry,only,the,most,important,messages,[END]
this,one,came,to,tell,us,that,the,conclave,has,met,considered,the,reports,and,measurements,made,by,maesters,all,over,the,realm,and,declared,this,great,summer,done,at,last,[END]
ten,years,two,turns,and,sixteen,days,it,lasted,the,longest,summer,in,living,memory,[END]
will,it,get,cold,now,shireen,was,a,summer,child,and,had,never,known,true,cold,[END]
in,time,cressen,replied,[END]
if,the,gods,are,good,they,will,grant,us,a,warm,autumn,and,bountiful,harvests,so,we,might,prepare,for,the,winter,to,come,the,smallfolk,said,that,a,long,summer,meant,an,even,longer,winter,but,the,maester,saw,no,reason,to,frighten,the,child,with,such,tales,[END]
patchface,rang,his,bells,[END]
it,is,always,summer,under,the,sea,he,intoned,[END]
the,merwives,wear,nennymoans,in,their,hair,and,weave,gowns,of,silver,seaweed,[END]

ah,here,is,pylos,with,the,bird,[END]
shireen,gave,a,cry,of,delight,[END]
even,cressen,had,to,admit,the,bird,made,an,impressive,sight,white,as,snow,and,larger,than,any,hawk,with,the,bright,black,eyes,that,meant,it,was,no,mere,albino,but,a,truebred,white,raven,of,the,citadel,[END]

my,favorite,time,it,was,said,that,no,one,had,ever,handled,a,ship,by,night,half,so,well,as,davos,shorthand,[END]
before,lord,stannis,had,knighted,him,he,had,been,the,most,notorious,and,elusive,smuggler,in,all,the,seven,kingdoms,[END]
and,[END]
the,man,shook,his,head,[END]
it,is,as,you,warned,him,[END]
they,will,not,rise,maester,[END]
not,for,him,[END]
they,do,not,love,him,[END]
no,cressen,thought,[END]
nor,will,they,ever,[END]
he,is,strong,able,just,[END]
aye,just,past,the,point,of,wisdom,[END]
yet,it,is,not,enough,[END]
it,has,never,been,enough,[END]
you,spoke,to,them,all,[END]
all,[END]
no,[END]

the,others,well,beric,dondarrion,is,gone,missing,some,say,dead,and,lord,caron,is,with,renly,[END]

the,rainbow,guard,[END]

each,one,has,his,own,color,[END]
loras,tyrell,s,their,lord,commander,[END]
it,was,just,the,sort,of,notion,that,would,appeal,to,renly,baratheon,a,splendid,new,order,of,knighthood,with,gorgeous,new,raiment,to,proclaim,it,[END]
even,as,a,boy,renly,had,loved,bright,colors,and,rich,fabrics,and,he,had,loved,his,games,as,well,[END]

is,there,anyone,who,cares,for,him,but,me,[END]
what,reasons,did,the,lords,give,for,their,refusals,he,asked,ser,davos,[END]
well,as,to,that,some,gave,me,soft,words,and,some,blunt,some,made,excuses,some,promises,some,only,lied,he,shrugged,[END]
in,the,end,words,are,just,wind,[END]
you,could,bring,him,no,hope,[END]
only,the,false,sort,and,i,d,not,do,that,davos,said,[END]
he,had,the,truth,from,me,[END]
maester,cressen,remembered,the,day,davos,had,been,knighted,after,the,siege,of,storm,s,end,[END]
lord,stannis,and,a,small,garrison,had,held,the,castle,for,close,to,a,year,against,the,great,host,of,the,lords,tyrell,and,redwyne,[END]
even,the,sea,was,closed,against,them,watched,day,and,night,by,redwyne,galleys,flying,the,burgundy,banners,of,the,arbor,[END]
within,storm,s,end,the,horses,had,long,since,been,eaten,the,dogs,and,cats,were,gone,and,the,garrison,was,down,to,roots,and,rats,[END]
then,came,a,night,when,the,moon,was,new,and,black,clouds,hid,the,stars,[END]
cloaked,in,that,darkness,davos,the,smuggler,had,dared,the,redwyne,cordon,and,the,rocks,of,shipbreaker,bay,alike,[END]
his,little,ship,had,a,black,hull,black,sails,black,oars,and,a,hold,crammed,with,onions,and,salt,fish,[END]
little,enough,yet,it,had,kept,the,garrison,alive,long,enough,for,eddard,stark,to,reach,storm,s,end,and,break,the,siege,[END]
lord,stannis,had,rewarded,davos,with,choice,lands,on,cape,wrath,a,small,keep,and,a,knight,s,honors,[END]
but,he,had,also,decreed,that,he,lose,a,joint,of,each,finger,on,his,left,hand,to,pay,for,all,his,years,of,smuggling,[END]
davos,had,submitted,on,the,condition,that,stannis,wield,the,knife,himself,he,would,accept,no,punishment,from,lesser,hands,[END]
the,lord,had,used,a,butcher,s,cleaver,the,better,to,cut,clean,and,true,[END]
afterward,davos,had,chosen,the,name,seaworth,for,his,new-made,house,and,he,took,for,his,banner,a,black,ship,on,a,pale,grey,field,with,an,onion,on,its,sails,[END]
the,onetime,smuggler,was,fond,of,saying,that,lord,stannis,had,done,him,a,boon,by,giving,him,four,less,fingernails,to,clean,and,trim,[END]
no,cressen,thought,a,man,like,that,would,give,no,false,hope,nor,soften,a,hard,truth,[END]
ser,davos,truth,can,be,a,bitter,draught,even,for,a,man,like,lord,stannis,[END]
he,thinks,only,of,returning,to,king,s,landing,in,the,fullness,of,his,power,to,tear,down,his,enemies,and,claim,what,is,rightfully,his,[END]
yet,now,[END]
if,he,takes,this,meager,host,to,king,s,landing,it,will,be,only,to,die,[END]
he,does,not,have,the,numbers,[END]
i,told,him,as,much,but,you,know,his,pride,davos,held,up,his,gloved,hand,[END]
my,fingers,will,grow,back,before,that,man,bends,to,sense,[END]
the,old,man,sighed,[END]
you,have,done,all,you,could,[END]
now,i,must,add,my,voice,to,yours,wearily,he,resumed,his,climb,[END]
lord,stannis,baratheon,s,refuge,was,a,great,round,room,with,walls,of,bare,black,stone,and,four,tall,narrow,windows,that,looked,out,to,the,four,points,of,the,compass,[END]
in,the,center,of,the,chamber,was,the,great,table,from,which,it,took,its,name,a,massive,slab,of,carved,wood,fashioned,at,the,command,of,aegon,targaryen,in,the,days,before,the,conquest,[END]
the,painted,table,was,more,than,fifty,feet,long,perhaps,half,that,wide,at,its,widest,point,but,less,than,four,feet,across,at,its,narrowest,[END]
aegon,s,carpenters,had,shaped,it,after,the,land,of,westeros,sawing,out,each,bay,and,peninsula,until,the,table,nowhere,ran,straight,[END]
on,its,surface,darkened,by,near,three,hundred,years,of,varnish,were,painted,the,seven,kingdoms,as,they,had,been,in,aegon,s,day,rivers,and,mountains,castles,and,cities,lakes,and,forests,[END]
there,was,a,single,chair,in,the,room,carefully,positioned,in,the,precise,place,that,dragonstone,occupied,off,the,coast,of,westeros,and,raised,up,to,give,a,good,view,of,the,tabletop,[END]
seated,in,the,chair,was,a,man,in,a,tight-laced,leather,jerkin,and,breeches,of,roughspun,brown,wool,[END]
when,maester,cressen,entered,he,glanced,up,[END]
i,knew,you,would,come,old,man,whether,i,summoned,you,or,no,there,was,no,hint,of,warmth,in,his,voice,there,seldom,was,[END]
stannis,baratheon,lord,of,dragonstone,and,by,the,grace,of,the,gods,rightful,heir,to,the,iron,throne,of,the,seven,kingdoms,of,westeros,was,broad,of,shoulder,and,sinewy,of,limb,with,a,tightness,to,his,face,and,flesh,that,spoke,of,leather,cured,in,the,sun,until,it,was,as,tough,as,steel,[END]
hard,was,the,word,men,used,when,they,spoke,of,stannis,and,hard,he,was,[END]
though,he,was,not,yet,five-and-thirty,only,a,fringe,of,thin,black,hair,remained,on,his,head,circling,behind,his,ears,like,the,shadow,of,a,crown,[END]
his,brother,the,late,king,robert,had,grown,a,beard,in,his,final,years,[END]
maester,cressen,had,never,seen,it,but,they,said,it,was,a,wild,thing,thick,and,fierce,[END]
as,if,in,answer,stannis,kept,his,own,whiskers,cropped,tight,and,short,[END]
they,lay,like,a,blue-black,shadow,across,his,square,jaw,and,the,bony,hollows,of,his,cheeks,[END]
his,eyes,were,open,wounds,beneath,his,heavy,brows,a,blue,as,dark,as,the,sea,by,night,[END]
his,mouth,would,have,given,despair,to,even,the,drollest,of,fools,it,was,a,mouth,made,for,frowns,and,scowls,and,sharply,worded,commands,all,thin,pale,lips,and,clenched,muscles,a,mouth,that,had,forgotten,how,to,smile,and,had,never,known,how,to,laugh,[END]
sometimes,when,the,world,grew,very,still,and,silent,of,a,night,maester,cressen,fancied,he,could,hear,lord,stannis,grinding,his,teeth,half,a,castle,away,[END]
once,you,would,have,woken,me,the,old,man,said,[END]
once,you,were,young,[END]
now,you,are,old,and,sick,and,need,your,sleep,stannis,had,never,learned,to,soften,his,speech,to,dissemble,or,flatter,he,said,what,he,thought,and,those,that,did,not,like,it,could,be,damned,[END]
i,knew,you,d,learn,what,davos,had,to,say,soon,enough,[END]
you,always,do,don,t,you,[END]
i,would,be,of,no,help,to,you,if,i,did,not,cressen,said,[END]
i,met,davos,on,the,stair,[END]
and,he,told,all,i,suppose,[END]
i,should,have,had,the,man,s,tongue,shortened,along,with,his,fingers,[END]
he,would,have,made,you,a,poor,envoy,then,[END]
he,made,me,a,poor,envoy,in,any,case,[END]
the,storm,lords,will,not,rise,for,me,[END]
it,seems,they,do,not,like,me,and,the,justice,of,my,cause,means,nothing,to,them,[END]
the,cravenly,ones,will,sit,behind,their,walls,waiting,to,see,how,the,wind,rises,and,who,is,likely,to,triumph,[END]

storm,s,end,belonged,to,house,baratheon,for,three,hundred,years,by,rights,it,should,have,passed,to,me,when,robert,took,the,iron,throne,[END]
it,was,an,old,grievance,deeply,felt,and,never,more,so,than,now,[END]
here,was,the,heart,of,his,lord,s,weakness,for,dragonstone,old,and,strong,though,it,was,commanded,the,allegiance,of,only,a,handful,of,lesser,lords,whose,stony,island,holdings,were,too,thinly,peopled,to,yield,up,the,men,that,stannis,needed,[END]
even,with,the,sellswords,he,had,brought,across,the,narrow,sea,from,the,free,cities,of,myr,and,lys,the,host,camped,outside,his,walls,was,far,too,small,to,bring,down,the,power,of,house,lannister,[END]
robert,did,you,an,injustice,maester,cressen,replied,carefully,yet,he,had,sound,reasons,[END]
dragonstone,had,long,been,the,seat,of,house,targaryen,[END]

servants,came,and,went,clearing,the,dishes,from,the,table,[END]
he,told,them,to,leave,the,wine,[END]
when,they,were,done,varys,came,gliding,into,the,hall,wearing,flowing,lavender,robes,that,matched,his,smell,[END]
oh,sweetly,done,my,good,lord,[END]
then,why,do,i,have,this,bitter,taste,in,my,mouth,he,pressed,his,fingers,into,his,temples,[END]
i,told,them,to,throw,allar,deem,into,the,sea,[END]
i,am,sorely,tempted,to,do,the,same,with,you,[END]

i,wondered,what,that,noise,was,[END]
tell,the,grapes,to,keep,still,my,head,is,about,to,split,[END]
it,was,my,sister,[END]
that,was,what,the,oh-so-loyal,lord,janos,refused,to,say,[END]
cersei,sent,the,gold,cloaks,to,that,brothel,[END]
varys,tittered,nervously,[END]
so,he,had,known,all,along,[END]
you,left,that,part,out,tyrion,said,accusingly,[END]
your,own,sweet,sister,varys,said,so,grief-stricken,he,looked,close,to,tears,[END]
it,is,a,hard,thing,to,tell,a,man,my,lord,[END]
i,was,fearful,how,you,might,take,it,[END]
can,you,forgive,me,[END]
no,tyrion,snapped,[END]
damn,you,[END]
damn,her,he,could,not,touch,cersei,he,knew,[END]
not,yet,not,even,if,he,d,wanted,to,and,he,was,far,from,certain,that,he,did,[END]
yet,it,rankled,to,sit,here,and,make,a,mummer,s,show,of,justice,by,punishing,the,sorry,likes,of,janos,slynt,and,allar,deem,while,his,sister,continued,on,her,savage,course,[END]
in,future,you,will,tell,me,what,you,know,lord,varys,[END]
all,of,what,you,know,[END]
the,eunuch,s,smile,was,sly,[END]
that,might,take,rather,a,long,time,my,good,lord,[END]
i,know,quite,a,lot,[END]
not,enough,to,save,this,child,it,would,seem,[END]
alas,no,[END]
there,was,another,bastard,a,boy,older,[END]
i,took,steps,to,see,him,removed,from,harm,s,way,[END]
but,i,confess,i,never,dreamed,the,babe,would,be,at,risk,[END]
a,baseborn,girl,less,than,a,year,old,with,a,whore,for,a,mother,[END]
what,threat,could,she,pose,[END]
she,was,robert,s,tyrion,said,bitterly,[END]
that,was,enough,for,cersei,it,would,seem,[END]
yes,[END]
it,is,grievous,sad,[END]
i,must,blame,myself,for,the,poor,sweet,babe,and,her,mother,who,was,so,young,and,loved,the,king,[END]
did,she,tyrion,had,never,seen,the,dead,girl,s,face,but,in,his,mind,she,was,shae,and,tysha,both,[END]
can,a,whore,truly,love,anyone,i,wonder,[END]
no,don,t,answer,[END]
some,things,i,would,rather,not,know,he,had,settled,shae,in,a,sprawling,stone-and-timber,manse,with,its,own,well,and,stable,and,garden,he,had,given,her,servants,to,see,to,her,wants,a,white,bird,from,the,summer,isles,to,keep,her,company,silks,and,silver,and,gemstones,to,adorn,her,guards,to,protect,her,[END]
and,yet,she,seemed,restive,[END]
she,wanted,to,be,with,him,more,she,told,him,she,wanted,to,serve,him,and,help,him,[END]
you,help,me,most,here,between,the,sheets,he,told,her,one,night,after,their,loving,as,he,lay,beside,her,his,head,pillowed,against,her,breast,his,groin,aching,with,a,sweet,soreness,[END]
she,made,no,reply,save,with,her,eyes,[END]
he,could,see,there,that,it,was,not,what,she,d,wanted,to,hear,[END]
sighing,tyrion,started,to,reach,for,the,wine,again,then,remembered,lord,janos,and,pushed,the,flagon,away,[END]
it,does,seem,my,sister,was,telling,the,truth,about,stark,s,death,[END]
we,have,my,nephew,to,thank,for,that,madness,[END]
king,joffrey,gave,the,command,[END]
janos,slynt,and,ser,ilyn,payne,carried,it,out,swiftly,without,hesitation,[END]
almost,as,if,they,had,expected,it,[END]
yes,we,have,been,over,this,ground,before,without,profit,[END]
a,folly,[END]
with,the,city,watch,in,hand,my,lord,you,are,well,placed,to,see,to,it,that,his,grace,commits,no,further,[END]
follies,[END]
to,be,sure,there,is,still,the,queen,s,household,guard,to,consider,[END]
the,red,cloaks,tyrion,shrugged,[END]
vylarr,s,loyalty,is,to,casterly,rock,[END]
he,knows,i,am,here,with,my,father,s,authority,[END]
cersei,would,find,it,hard,to,use,his,men,against,me,[END]
besides,they,are,only,a,hundred,[END]
i,have,half,again,as,many,men,of,my,own,[END]
and,six,thousand,gold,cloaks,if,bywater,is,the,man,you,claim,[END]
you,will,find,ser,jacelyn,to,be,courageous,honorable,obedient,[END]
and,most,grateful,[END]
to,whom,i,wonder,tyrion,did,not,trust,varys,though,there,was,no,denying,his,value,[END]
he,knew,things,beyond,a,doubt,[END]
why,are,you,so,helpful,my,lord,varys,he,asked,studying,the,man,s,soft,hands,the,bald,powdered,face,the,slimy,little,smile,[END]
you,are,the,hand,[END]
i,serve,the,realm,the,king,and,you,[END]
as,you,served,jon,arryn,and,eddard,stark,[END]
i,served,lord,arryn,and,lord,stark,as,best,i,could,[END]
i,was,saddened,and,horrified,by,their,most,untimely,deaths,[END]
think,how,i,feel,[END]
i,m,like,to,be,next,[END]
oh,i,think,not,varys,said,swirling,the,wine,in,his,cup,[END]
power,is,a,curious,thing,my,lord,[END]
perchance,you,have,considered,the,riddle,i,posed,you,that,day,in,the,inn,[END]
it,has,crossed,my,mind,a,time,or,two,tyrion,admitted,[END]
the,king,the,priest,the,rich,man,who,lives,and,who,dies,[END]
who,will,the,swordsman,obey,[END]
it,s,a,riddle,without,an,answer,or,rather,too,many,answers,[END]
all,depends,on,the,man,with,the,sword,[END]
and,yet,he,is,no,one,varys,said,[END]
he,has,neither,crown,nor,gold,nor,favor,of,the,gods,only,a,piece,of,pointed,steel,[END]
that,piece,of,steel,is,the,power,of,life,and,death,[END]
just,so,[END]
yet,if,it,is,the,swordsmen,who,rule,us,in,truth,why,do,we,pretend,our,kings,hold,the,power,[END]
why,should,a,strong,man,with,a,sword,ever,obey,a,child,king,like,joffrey,or,a,wine-sodden,oaf,like,his,father,[END]
because,these,child,kings,and,drunken,oafs,can,call,other,strong,men,with,other,swords,[END]
then,these,other,swordsmen,have,the,true,power,[END]
or,do,they,[END]
whence,came,their,swords,[END]
why,do,they,obey,varys,smiled,[END]
some,say,knowledge,is,power,[END]
some,tell,us,that,all,power,comes,from,the,gods,[END]
others,say,it,derives,from,law,[END]
yet,that,day,on,the,steps,of,baelor,s,sept,our,godly,high,septon,and,the,lawful,queen,regent,and,your,ever-so-knowledgeable,servant,were,as,powerless,as,any,cobbler,or,cooper,in,the,crowd,[END]
who,truly,killed,eddard,stark,do,you,think,[END]
joffrey,who,gave,the,command,[END]
ser,ilyn,payne,who,swung,the,sword,[END]
or,[END]
another,[END]
tyrion,cocked,his,head,sideways,[END]
did,you,mean,to,answer,your,damned,riddle,or,only,to,make,my,head,ache,worse,[END]
varys,smiled,[END]
here,then,[END]
power,resides,where,men,believe,it,resides,[END]
no,more,and,no,less,[END]
so,power,is,a,mummer,s,trick,[END]
a,shadow,on,the,wall,varys,murmured,yet,shadows,can,kill,[END]
and,ofttimes,a,very,small,man,can,cast,a,very,large,shadow,[END]
tyrion,smiled,[END]
lord,varys,i,am,growing,strangely,fond,of,you,[END]
i,may,kill,you,yet,but,i,think,i,d,feel,sad,about,it,[END]
i,will,take,that,as,high,praise,[END]
what,are,you,varys,tyrion,found,he,truly,wanted,to,know,[END]
a,spider,they,say,[END]
spies,and,informers,are,seldom,loved,my,lord,[END]
i,am,but,a,loyal,servant,of,the,realm,[END]
and,a,eunuch,[END]
let,us,not,forget,that,[END]
i,seldom,do,[END]
people,have,called,me,a,halfman,too,yet,i,think,the,gods,have,been,kinder,to,me,[END]
i,am,small,my,legs,are,twisted,and,women,do,not,look,upon,me,with,any,great,yearning,[END]
yet,i,m,still,a,man,[END]
shae,is,not,the,first,to,grace,my,bed,and,one,day,i,may,take,a,wife,and,sire,a,son,[END]
if,the,gods,are,good,he,ll,look,like,his,uncle,and,think,like,his,father,[END]
you,have,no,such,hope,to,sustain,you,[END]
dwarfs,are,a,jape,of,the,gods,[END]
but,men,make,eunuchs,[END]
who,cut,you,varys,[END]
when,and,why,[END]
who,are,you,truly,[END]
the,eunuch,s,smile,never,flickered,but,his,eyes,glittered,with,something,that,was,not,laughter,[END]
you,are,kind,to,ask,my,lord,but,my,tale,is,long,and,sad,and,we,have,treasons,to,discuss,he,drew,a,parchment,from,the,sleeve,of,his,robe,[END]
the,master,of,the,king,s,galley,white,hart,plots,to,slip,anchor,three,days,hence,to,offer,his,sword,and,ship,to,lord,stannis,[END]

i,suppose,we,must,make,some,sort,of,bloody,lesson,out,of,the,man,[END]
ser,jacelyn,could,arrange,for,him,to,vanish,but,a,trial,before,the,king,would,help,assure,the,continued,loyalty,of,the,other,captains,[END]
and,keep,my,royal,nephew,occupied,as,well,[END]
as,you,say,[END]
put,him,down,for,a,dose,of,joffrey,s,justice,[END]
varys,made,a,mark,on,the,parchment,[END]
ser,horas,and,ser,hobber,redwyne,have,bribed,a,guard,to,let,them,out,a,postern,gate,the,night,after,next,[END]

can,we,keep,them,on,those,oars,for,a,few,years,see,how,they,fancy,it,he,smiled,[END]
no,my,sister,would,be,distraught,to,lose,such,treasured,guests,[END]
inform,ser,jacelyn,[END]
seize,the,man,they,bribed,and,explain,what,an,honor,it,is,to,serve,as,a,brother,of,the,night,s,watch,[END]

oh,beyond,a,doubt,[END]
then,the,honest,men,of,the,city,owe,timett,a,debt,of,gratitude,[END]
i,shall,see,that,he,has,the,king,s,thanks,[END]
the,eunuch,gave,a,nervous,giggle,and,made,another,mark,[END]
we,also,have,a,sudden,plague,of,holy,men,[END]
the,comet,has,brought,forth,all,manner,of,queer,priests,preachers,and,prophets,it,would,seem,[END]
they,beg,in,the,winesinks,and,pot-shops,and,foretell,doom,and,destruction,to,anyone,who,stops,to,listen,[END]
tyrion,shrugged,[END]
we,are,close,on,the,three,hundredth,year,since,aegon,s,landing,i,suppose,it,is,only,to,be,expected,[END]

you,are,very,cruel,to,say,so,[END]
one,last,matter,[END]

not,happily,if,he,was,any,judge,but,beyond,sending,an,angry,protest,to,lord,tywin,in,harrenhal,he,did,not,see,what,cersei,could,hope,to,do,about,it,[END]
tyrion,had,the,city,watch,now,plus,a,hundred-and-a-half,fierce,clansmen,and,a,growing,force,of,sellswords,recruited,by,bronn,[END]
he,would,seem,well,protected,[END]
doubtless,eddard,stark,thought,the,same,[END]
the,red,keep,was,dark,and,still,when,tyrion,left,the,small,hall,[END]
bronn,was,waiting,in,his,solar,[END]
slynt,he,asked,[END]
lord,janos,will,be,sailing,for,the,wall,on,the,morning,tide,[END]
varys,would,have,me,believe,that,i,have,replaced,one,of,joffrey,s,men,with,one,of,my,own,[END]
more,likely,i,have,replaced,littlefinger,s,man,with,one,belonging,to,varys,but,so,be,it,[END]

arya,[END]
the,road,was,little,more,than,two,ruts,through,the,weeds,[END]
the,good,part,was,with,so,little,traffic,there,d,be,no,one,to,point,the,finger,and,say,which,way,they,d,gone,[END]
the,human,flood,that,had,flowed,down,the,kingsroad,was,only,a,trickle,here,[END]
the,bad,part,was,the,road,wound,back,and,forth,like,a,snake,tangling,with,even,smaller,trails,and,sometimes,seeming,to,vanish,entirely,only,to,reappear,half,a,league,farther,on,when,they,had,all,but,given,up,hope,[END]
arya,hated,it,[END]
the,land,was,gentle,enough,rolling,hills,and,terraced,fields,interspersed,with,meadows,and,woodlands,and,little,valleys,where,willows,crowded,close,to,slow,shallow,streams,[END]
even,so,the,path,was,so,narrow,and,crooked,that,their,pace,had,dropped,to,a,crawl,[END]
it,was,the,wagons,that,slowed,them,lumbering,along,axles,creaking,under,the,weight,of,their,heavy,loads,[END]
a,dozen,times,a,day,they,had,to,stop,to,free,a,wheel,that,had,stuck,in,a,rut,or,double,up,the,teams,to,climb,a,muddy,slope,[END]
once,in,the,middle,of,a,dense,stand,of,oak,they,came,face-to-face,with,three,men,pulling,a,load,of,firewood,in,an,ox,cart,with,no,way,for,either,to,get,around,[END]
there,had,been,nothing,for,it,but,to,wait,while,the,foresters,unhitched,their,ox,led,him,through,the,trees,spun,the,cart,hitched,the,ox,up,again,and,started,back,the,way,they,d,come,[END]
the,ox,was,even,slower,than,the,wagons,so,that,day,they,hardly,got,anywhere,at,all,[END]
arya,could,not,help,looking,over,her,shoulder,wondering,when,the,gold,cloaks,would,catch,them,[END]
at,night,she,woke,at,every,noise,to,grab,for,needle,s,hilt,[END]

above,the,sea,tower,snapped,his,father,s,banner,[END]
the,myraham,was,too,far,off,for,theon,to,see,more,than,the,cloth,itself,but,he,knew,the,device,it,bore,the,golden,kraken,of,house,greyjoy,arms,writhing,and,reaching,against,a,black,field,[END]
the,banner,streamed,from,an,iron,mast,shivering,and,twisting,as,the,wind,gusted,like,a,bird,struggling,to,take,flight,[END]

it,looks,smaller,theon,confessed,though,perhaps,that,is,only,the,distance,the,myraham,was,a,fat-bellied,southron,merchanter,up,from,oldtown,carrying,wine,and,cloth,and,seed,to,trade,for,iron,ore,her,captain,was,a,fat-bellied,southron,merchanter,as,well,and,the,stony,sea,that,foamed,at,the,feet,of,the,castle,made,his,plump,lips,quiver,so,he,stayed,well,out,farther,than,theon,would,have,liked,[END]
an,ironborn,captain,in,a,longship,would,have,taken,them,along,the,cliffs,and,under,the,high,bridge,that,spanned,the,gap,between,the,gatehouse,and,the,great,keep,but,this,plump,oldtowner,had,neither,the,craft,the,crew,nor,the,courage,to,attempt,such,a,thing,[END]
so,they,sailed,past,at,a,safe,distance,and,theon,must,content,himself,with,seeing,pyke,from,afar,[END]

that,was,surprising,at,her,age,but,theon,found,it,diverting,[END]

we,are,commanded,not,to,speak,of,this,to,any,man,[END]

if,my,father,makes,plans,for,war,i,must,know,of,them,[END]
i,am,not,any,man,i,am,heir,to,pyke,and,the,iron,islands,[END]

now,be,silent,[END]
the,ride,is,long,enough,without,your,magpie,chatterings,[END]
theon,held,his,tongue,though,not,without,struggle,[END]
so,that,is,the,way,of,it,he,thought,[END]
as,if,ten,years,in,winterfell,could,make,a,stark,[END]
lord,eddard,had,raised,him,among,his,own,children,but,theon,had,never,been,one,of,them,[END]
the,whole,castle,from,lady,stark,to,the,lowliest,kitchen,scullion,knew,he,was,hostage,to,his,father,s,good,behavior,and,treated,him,accordingly,[END]
even,the,bastard,jon,snow,had,been,accorded,more,honor,than,he,had,[END]
lord,eddard,had,tried,to,play,the,father,from,time,to,time,but,to,theon,he,had,always,remained,the,man,who,d,brought,blood,and,fire,to,pyke,and,taken,him,from,his,home,[END]
as,a,boy,he,had,lived,in,fear,of,stark,s,stern,face,and,great,dark,sword,[END]
his,wife,was,if,anything,even,more,distant,and,suspicious,[END]
as,for,their,children,the,younger,ones,had,been,mewling,babes,for,most,of,his,years,at,winterfell,[END]
only,robb,and,his,baseborn,half,brother,jon,snow,had,been,old,enough,to,be,worth,his,notice,[END]
the,bastard,was,a,sullen,boy,quick,to,sense,a,slight,jealous,of,theon,s,high,birth,and,robb,s,regard,for,him,[END]
for,robb,himself,theon,did,have,a,certain,affection,as,for,a,younger,brother,[END]
but,it,would,be,best,not,to,mention,that,[END]
in,pyke,it,would,seem,the,old,wars,were,still,being,fought,[END]
that,ought,not,surprise,him,[END]
the,iron,islands,lived,in,the,past,the,present,was,too,hard,and,bitter,to,be,borne,[END]
besides,his,father,and,uncles,were,old,and,the,old,lords,were,like,that,they,took,their,dusty,feuds,to,the,grave,forgetting,nothing,and,forgiving,less,[END]
it,had,been,the,same,with,the,mallisters,his,companions,on,the,ride,from,riverrun,to,seagard,[END]
patrek,mallister,was,not,too,ill,a,fellow,they,shared,a,taste,for,wenches,wine,and,hawking,[END]
but,when,old,lord,jason,saw,his,heir,growing,overly,fond,of,theon,s,company,he,had,taken,patrek,aside,to,remind,him,that,seagard,had,been,built,to,defend,the,coast,against,reavers,from,the,iron,islands,the,greyjoys,of,pyke,chief,among,them,[END]
their,booming,tower,was,named,for,its,immense,bronze,bell,rung,of,old,to,call,the,townsfolk,and,farmhands,into,the,castle,when,longships,were,sighted,on,the,western,horizon,[END]
never,mind,that,the,bell,has,been,rung,just,once,in,three,hundred,years,patrek,had,told,theon,the,day,after,as,he,shared,his,father,s,cautions,and,a,jug,of,green-apple,wine,[END]
when,my,brother,stormed,seagard,theon,said,[END]
lord,jason,had,slain,rodrik,greyjoy,under,the,walls,of,the,castle,and,thrown,the,ironmen,back,into,the,bay,[END]
if,your,father,supposes,i,bear,him,some,enmity,for,that,it,s,only,because,he,never,knew,rodrik,[END]
they,had,a,laugh,over,that,as,they,raced,ahead,to,an,amorous,young,miller,s,wife,that,patrek,knew,[END]
would,that,patrek,were,with,me,now,[END]
mallister,or,no,he,was,a,more,amiable,riding,companion,than,this,sour,old,priest,that,his,uncle,aeron,had,turned,into,[END]
the,path,they,rode,wound,up,and,up,into,bare,and,stony,hills,[END]
soon,they,were,out,of,sight,of,the,sea,though,the,smell,of,salt,still,hung,sharp,in,the,damp,air,[END]
they,kept,a,steady,plodding,pace,past,a,shepherd,s,croft,and,the,abandoned,workings,of,a,mine,[END]
this,new,holy,aeron,greyjoy,was,not,much,for,talk,[END]
they,rode,in,a,gloom,of,silence,[END]
finally,theon,could,suffer,it,no,longer,[END]
robb,stark,is,lord,of,winterfell,now,he,said,[END]
aeron,rode,on,[END]
one,wolf,is,much,like,the,other,[END]

this,news,is,old,and,cold,[END]
it,means,a,new,day,uncle,[END]
every,morning,brings,a,new,day,much,like,the,old,[END]
in,riverrun,they,would,tell,you,different,[END]
they,say,the,red,comet,is,a,herald,of,a,new,age,[END]
a,messenger,from,the,gods,[END]
a,sign,it,is,the,priest,agreed,but,from,our,god,not,theirs,[END]
a,burning,brand,it,is,such,as,our,people,carried,of,old,[END]
it,is,the,flame,the,drowned,god,brought,from,the,sea,and,it,proclaims,a,rising,tide,[END]
it,is,time,to,hoist,our,sails,and,go,forth,into,the,world,with,fire,and,sword,as,he,did,[END]
theon,smiled,[END]
i,could,not,agree,more,[END]
a,man,agrees,with,god,as,a,raindrop,with,the,storm,[END]
this,raindrop,will,one,day,be,a,king,old,man,[END]
theon,had,suffered,quite,enough,of,his,uncle,s,gloom,[END]
he,put,his,spurs,into,his,horse,and,trotted,on,ahead,smiling,[END]
it,was,nigh,on,sunset,when,they,reached,the,walls,of,pyke,a,crescent,of,dark,stone,that,ran,from,cliff,to,cliff,with,the,gatehouse,in,the,center,and,three,square,towers,to,either,side,[END]
theon,could,still,make,out,the,scars,left,by,the,stones,of,robert,baratheon,s,catapults,[END]
a,new,south,tower,had,risen,from,the,ruins,of,the,old,its,stone,a,paler,shade,of,grey,and,as,yet,unmarred,by,patches,of,lichen,[END]
that,was,where,robert,had,made,his,breach,swarming,in,over,the,rubble,and,corpses,with,his,warhammer,in,hand,and,ned,stark,at,his,side,[END]
theon,had,watched,from,the,safety,of,the,sea,tower,and,sometimes,he,still,saw,the,torches,in,his,dreams,and,heard,the,dull,thunder,of,the,collapse,[END]
the,gates,stood,open,to,him,the,rusted,iron,portcullis,drawn,up,[END]
the,guards,atop,the,battlements,watched,with,strangers,eyes,as,theon,greyjoy,came,home,at,last,[END]
beyond,the,curtain,wall,were,half,a,hundred,acres,of,headland,hard,against,the,sky,and,the,sea,[END]
the,stables,were,here,and,the,kennels,and,a,scatter,of,other,outbuildings,[END]
sheep,and,swine,huddled,in,their,pens,while,the,castle,dogs,ran,free,[END]
to,the,south,were,the,cliffs,and,the,wide,stone,bridge,to,the,great,keep,[END]
theon,could,hear,the,crashing,of,waves,as,he,swung,down,from,his,saddle,[END]
a,stableman,came,to,take,his,horse,[END]
a,pair,of,gaunt,children,and,some,thralls,stared,at,him,with,dull,eyes,but,there,was,no,sign,of,his,lord,father,nor,anyone,else,he,recalled,from,boyhood,[END]
a,bleak,and,bitter,homecoming,he,thought,[END]
the,priest,had,not,dismounted,[END]
will,you,not,stay,the,night,and,share,our,meat,and,mead,uncle,[END]
bring,you,i,was,told,[END]
you,are,brought,[END]
now,i,return,to,our,god,s,business,aeron,greyjoy,turned,his,horse,and,rode,slowly,out,beneath,the,muddy,spikes,of,the,portcullis,[END]
a,bentback,old,crone,in,a,shapeless,grey,dress,approached,him,warily,[END]
m,lord,i,am,sent,to,show,you,to,chambers,[END]

your,lord,father,m,lord,[END]
theon,pulled,off,his,gloves,[END]

and,who,are,you,[END]
helya,who,keeps,this,castle,for,your,lord,father,[END]
sylas,was,steward,here,[END]
they,called,him,sourmouth,even,now,theon,could,recall,the,winey,stench,of,the,old,man,s,breath,[END]
dead,these,five,years,m,lord,[END]
and,what,of,maester,qalen,where,is,he,[END]
he,sleeps,in,the,sea,[END]
wendamyr,keeps,the,ravens,now,[END]
it,is,as,if,i,were,a,stranger,here,theon,thought,[END]
nothing,has,changed,and,yet,everything,has,changed,[END]
show,me,to,my,chambers,woman,he,commanded,[END]
bowing,stiffly,she,led,him,across,the,headland,to,the,bridge,[END]
that,at,least,was,as,he,remembered,the,ancient,stones,slick,with,spray,and,spotted,by,lichen,the,sea,foaming,under,their,feet,like,some,great,wild,beast,the,salt,wind,clutching,at,their,clothes,[END]
whenever,he,d,imagined,his,homecoming,he,had,always,pictured,himself,returning,to,the,snug,bedchamber,in,the,sea,tower,where,he,d,slept,as,a,child,[END]
instead,the,old,woman,led,him,to,the,bloody,keep,[END]
the,halls,here,were,larger,and,better,furnished,if,no,less,cold,nor,damp,[END]
theon,was,given,a,suite,of,chilly,rooms,with,ceilings,so,high,that,they,were,lost,in,gloom,[END]
he,might,have,been,more,impressed,if,he,had,not,known,that,these,were,the,very,chambers,that,had,given,the,bloody,keep,its,name,[END]
a,thousand,years,before,the,sons,of,the,river,king,had,been,slaughtered,here,hacked,to,bits,in,their,beds,so,that,pieces,of,their,bodies,might,be,sent,back,to,their,father,on,the,mainland,[END]
but,greyjoys,were,not,murdered,in,pyke,except,once,in,a,great,while,by,their,brothers,and,his,brothers,were,both,dead,[END]
it,was,not,fear,of,ghosts,that,made,him,glance,about,with,distaste,[END]
the,wall,hangings,were,green,with,mildew,the,mattress,musty-smelling,and,sagging,the,rushes,old,and,brittle,[END]
years,had,come,and,gone,since,these,chambers,had,last,been,opened,[END]
the,damp,went,bone,deep,[END]
i,ll,have,a,basin,of,hot,water,and,a,fire,in,this,hearth,he,told,the,crone,[END]

yes,m,lord,[END]
as,you,command,she,fled,[END]
after,some,time,they,brought,the,hot,water,he,had,asked,for,[END]
it,was,only,tepid,and,soon,cold,and,seawater,in,the,bargain,but,it,served,to,wash,the,dust,of,the,long,ride,from,his,face,and,hair,and,hands,[END]
while,two,thralls,lit,his,braziers,theon,stripped,off,his,travel-stained,clothing,and,dressed,to,meet,his,father,[END]
he,chose,boots,of,supple,black,leather,soft,lambswool,breeches,of,silvery-grey,a,black,velvet,doublet,with,the,golden,kraken,of,the,greyjoys,embroidered,on,the,breast,[END]
around,his,throat,he,fastened,a,slender,gold,chain,around,his,waist,a,belt,of,bleached,white,leather,[END]
he,hung,a,dirk,at,one,hip,and,a,longsword,at,the,other,in,scabbards,striped,black-and-gold,[END]
drawing,the,dirk,he,tested,its,edge,with,his,thumb,pulled,a,whetstone,from,his,belt,pouch,and,gave,it,a,few,licks,[END]
he,prided,himself,on,keeping,his,weapons,sharp,[END]
when,i,return,i,shall,expect,a,warm,room,and,clean,rushes,he,warned,the,thralls,as,he,drew,on,a,pair,of,black,gloves,the,silk,decorated,with,a,delicate,scrollwork,tracery,in,golden,thread,[END]
theon,returned,to,the,great,keep,through,a,covered,stone,walkway,the,echoes,of,his,footsteps,mingling,with,the,ceaseless,rumble,of,the,sea,below,[END]
to,get,to,the,sea,tower,on,its,crooked,pillar,he,had,to,cross,three,further,bridges,each,narrower,than,the,one,before,[END]
the,last,was,made,of,rope,and,wood,and,the,wet,salt,wind,made,it,sway,underfoot,like,a,living,thing,[END]
theon,s,heart,was,in,his,mouth,by,the,time,he,was,halfway,across,[END]
a,long,way,below,the,waves,threw,up,tall,plumes,of,spray,as,they,crashed,against,the,rock,[END]
as,a,boy,he,used,to,run,across,this,bridge,even,in,the,black,of,night,[END]
boys,believe,nothing,can,hurt,them,his,doubt,whispered,[END]
grown,men,know,better,[END]
the,door,was,grey,wood,studded,with,iron,and,theon,found,it,barred,from,the,inside,[END]
he,hammered,on,it,with,a,fist,and,cursed,when,a,splinter,snagged,the,fabric,of,his,glove,[END]
the,wood,was,damp,and,moldy,the,iron,studs,rusted,[END]

out,of,my,way,or,you,ll,learn,who,i,am,the,man,stood,aside,[END]
theon,climbed,the,twisting,steps,to,the,solar,[END]

at,the,sound,of,boots,on,stone,the,lord,of,the,iron,islands,lifted,his,eyes,to,behold,his,last,living,son,[END]

and,so,gaunt,[END]
balon,greyjoy,had,always,been,thin,but,now,he,looked,as,though,the,gods,had,put,him,in,a,cauldron,and,boiled,every,spare,ounce,of,flesh,from,his,bones,until,nothing,remained,but,hair,and,skin,[END]
bone,thin,and,bone,hard,he,was,with,a,face,that,might,have,been,chipped,from,flint,[END]

only,a,fortnight,asked,dany,[END]
even,i,was,given,more,happiness,than,that,with,drogo,who,was,my,sun-and-stars,[END]
a,fortnight,was,how,long,it,took,us,to,sail,from,lannisport,back,to,bear,island,[END]
my,home,was,a,great,disappointment,to,lynesse,[END]
it,was,too,cold,too,damp,too,far,away,my,castle,no,more,than,a,wooden,longhall,[END]
we,had,no,masques,no,mummer,shows,no,balls,or,fairs,[END]
seasons,might,pass,without,a,singer,ever,coming,to,play,for,us,and,there,s,not,a,goldsmith,on,the,island,[END]
even,meals,became,a,trial,[END]
my,cook,knew,little,beyond,his,roasts,and,stews,and,lynesse,soon,lost,her,taste,for,fish,and,venison,[END]
i,lived,for,her,smiles,so,i,sent,all,the,way,to,oldtown,for,a,new,cook,and,brought,a,harper,from,lannisport,[END]
goldsmiths,jewelers,dressmakers,whatever,she,wanted,i,found,for,her,but,it,was,never,enough,[END]
bear,island,is,rich,in,bears,and,trees,and,poor,in,aught,else,[END]
i,built,a,fine,ship,for,her,and,we,sailed,to,lannisport,and,oldtown,for,festivals,and,fairs,and,once,even,to,braavos,where,i,borrowed,heavily,from,the,moneylenders,[END]
it,was,as,a,tourney,champion,that,i,had,won,her,hand,and,heart,so,i,entered,other,tourneys,for,her,sake,but,the,magic,was,gone,[END]
i,never,distinguished,myself,again,and,each,defeat,meant,the,loss,of,another,charger,and,another,suit,of,jousting,armor,which,must,needs,be,ransomed,or,replaced,[END]
the,cost,could,not,be,borne,[END]
finally,i,insisted,we,return,home,but,there,matters,soon,grew,even,worse,than,before,[END]
i,could,no,longer,pay,the,cook,and,the,harper,and,lynesse,grew,wild,when,i,spoke,of,pawning,her,jewels,[END]
the,rest,[END]

for,gold,[END]
so,lynesse,might,keep,her,jewels,her,harper,and,her,cook,[END]
in,the,end,it,cost,me,all,[END]
when,i,heard,that,eddard,stark,was,coming,to,bear,island,i,was,so,lost,to,honor,that,rather,than,stay,and,face,his,judgment,i,took,her,with,me,into,exile,[END]
nothing,mattered,but,our,love,i,told,myself,[END]
we,fled,to,lys,where,i,sold,my,ship,for,gold,to,keep,us,[END]
his,voice,was,thick,with,grief,and,dany,was,reluctant,to,press,him,any,further,yet,she,had,to,know,how,it,ended,[END]
did,she,die,there,she,asked,him,gently,[END]
only,to,me,he,said,[END]
in,half,a,year,my,gold,was,gone,and,i,was,obliged,to,take,service,as,a,sellsword,[END]
while,i,was,fighting,braavosi,on,the,rhoyne,lynesse,moved,into,the,manse,of,a,merchant,prince,named,tregar,ormollen,[END]
they,say,she,is,his,chief,concubine,now,and,even,his,wife,goes,in,fear,of,her,[END]

i,find,i,am,very,tired,[END]
she,gave,him,leave,to,go,but,as,he,was,lifting,the,flap,of,her,tent,she,could,not,stop,herself,calling,after,him,with,one,last,question,[END]
what,did,she,look,like,your,lady,lynesse,[END]
ser,jorah,smiled,sadly,[END]
why,she,looked,a,bit,like,you,daenerys,he,bowed,low,[END]
sleep,well,my,queen,[END]
dany,shivered,and,pulled,the,lionskin,tight,about,her,[END]
she,looked,like,me,[END]
it,explained,much,that,she,had,not,truly,understood,[END]
he,wants,me,she,realized,[END]
he,loves,me,as,he,loved,her,not,as,a,knight,loves,his,queen,but,as,a,man,loves,a,woman,[END]
she,tried,to,imagine,herself,in,ser,jorah,s,arms,kissing,him,pleasuring,him,letting,him,enter,her,[END]
it,was,no,good,[END]
when,she,closed,her,eyes,his,face,kept,changing,into,drogo,s,[END]
khal,drogo,had,been,her,sun-and-stars,her,first,and,perhaps,he,must,be,her,last,[END]
the,maegi,mirri,maz,duur,had,sworn,she,should,never,bear,a,living,child,and,what,man,would,want,a,barren,wife,[END]
and,what,man,could,hope,to,rival,drogo,who,had,died,with,his,hair,uncut,and,rode,now,through,the,night,lands,the,stars,his,khalasar,[END]
she,had,heard,the,longing,in,ser,jorah,s,voice,when,he,spoke,of,his,bear,island,[END]
he,can,never,have,me,but,one,day,i,can,give,him,back,his,home,and,honor,[END]
that,much,i,can,do,for,him,[END]
no,ghosts,troubled,her,sleep,that,night,[END]
she,dreamed,of,drogo,and,the,first,ride,they,had,taken,together,on,the,night,they,were,wed,in,the,dream,it,was,not,horses,they,rode,but,dragons,[END]
the,next,morn,she,summoned,her,bloodriders,[END]
blood,of,my,blood,she,told,the,three,of,them,i,have,need,of,you,[END]
each,of,you,is,to,choose,three,horses,the,hardiest,and,healthiest,that,remain,to,us,[END]
load,as,much,water,and,food,as,your,mounts,can,bear,and,ride,forth,for,me,[END]
aggo,shall,strike,southwest,rakharo,due,south,[END]
jhogo,you,are,to,follow,shierak,qiya,on,southeast,[END]
what,shall,we,seek,khaleesi,asked,jhogo,[END]
whatever,there,is,dany,answered,[END]
seek,for,other,cities,living,and,dead,[END]
seek,for,caravans,and,people,[END]

a,queer,choice,of,words,that,[END]
pycelle,cleared,his,throat,[END]

a,man,like,petyr,baelish,who,had,a,gift,for,rubbing,two,golden,dragons,together,to,breed,a,third,was,invaluable,to,his,hand,[END]
littlefinger,s,rise,had,been,arrow-swift,[END]
within,three,years,of,his,coming,to,court,he,was,master,of,coin,and,a,member,of,the,small,council,and,today,the,crown,s,revenues,were,ten,times,what,they,had,been,under,his,beleaguered,predecessor,[END]
though,the,crown,s,debts,had,grown,vast,as,well,[END]
a,master,juggler,was,petyr,baelish,[END]
oh,he,was,clever,[END]
he,did,not,simply,collect,the,gold,and,lock,it,in,a,treasure,vault,no,[END]
he,paid,the,king,s,debts,in,promises,and,put,the,king,s,gold,to,work,[END]

the,lie,tyrion,was,fairly,certain,it,was,a,lie,was,delivered,with,such,an,air,of,nonchalance,that,one,could,almost,believe,it,[END]
could,it,have,been,catelyn,stark,who,lied,[END]
about,her,defloration,and,the,dagger,as,well,[END]
the,longer,he,lived,the,more,tyrion,realized,that,nothing,was,simple,and,little,was,true,[END]
lord,hoster,s,daughters,do,not,love,me,he,confessed,[END]
i,doubt,they,would,listen,to,any,proposal,i,might,make,[END]
yet,coming,from,you,the,same,words,might,fall,more,sweetly,on,their,ears,[END]
that,would,depend,on,the,words,[END]

she,believes,she,has,good,reason,[END]
when,i,was,her,guest,in,the,eyrie,she,insisted,that,i,d,murdered,her,husband,and,was,not,inclined,to,listen,to,denials,he,leaned,forward,[END]
if,i,gave,her,jon,arryn,s,true,killer,she,might,think,more,kindly,of,me,[END]

i,could,help,her,with,that,[END]
a,word,from,me,[END]
and,what,would,this,word,cost,her,[END]
i,want,lady,lysa,and,her,son,to,acclaim,joffrey,as,king,to,swear,fealty,and,to,[END]
make,war,on,the,starks,and,tullys,littlefinger,shook,his,head,[END]
there,s,the,roach,in,your,pudding,lannister,[END]
lysa,will,never,send,her,knights,against,riverrun,[END]

we,have,no,lack,of,enemies,[END]
i,ll,use,her,power,to,oppose,lord,renly,or,lord,stannis,should,he,stir,from,dragonstone,[END]
in,return,i,will,give,her,justice,for,jon,arryn,and,peace,in,the,vale,[END]
i,will,even,name,that,appalling,child,of,hers,warden,of,the,east,as,his,father,was,before,him,i,want,to,see,him,fly,a,boy,s,voice,whispered,faintly,in,memory,[END]
and,to,seal,the,bargain,i,will,give,her,my,niece,[END]
he,had,the,pleasure,of,seeing,a,look,of,genuine,surprise,in,petyr,baelish,s,grey-green,eyes,[END]
myrcella,[END]
when,she,comes,of,age,she,can,wed,little,lord,robert,[END]
until,such,time,she,ll,be,lady,lysa,s,ward,at,the,eyrie,[END]
and,what,does,her,grace,the,queen,think,of,this,ploy,when,tyrion,shrugged,littlefinger,burst,into,laughter,[END]
i,thought,not,[END]
you,re,a,dangerous,little,man,lannister,[END]
yes,i,could,sing,this,song,to,lysa,again,the,sly,smile,the,mischief,in,his,glance,[END]
if,i,cared,to,[END]
tyrion,nodded,waiting,knowing,littlefinger,could,never,abide,a,long,silence,[END]
so,lord,petyr,continued,after,a,pause,utterly,unabashed,what,s,in,your,pot,for,me,[END]
harrenhal,[END]
it,was,interesting,to,watch,his,face,[END]
lord,petyr,s,father,had,been,the,smallest,of,small,lords,his,grandfather,a,landless,hedge,knight,by,birth,he,held,no,more,than,a,few,stony,acres,on,the,windswept,shore,of,the,fingers,[END]
harrenhal,was,one,of,the,richest,plums,in,the,seven,kingdoms,its,lands,broad,and,rich,and,fertile,its,great,castle,as,formidable,as,any,in,the,realm,[END]
and,so,large,as,to,dwarf,riverrun,where,petyr,baelish,had,been,fostered,by,house,tully,only,to,be,brusquely,expelled,when,he,dared,raise,his,sights,to,lord,hoster,s,daughter,[END]
littlefinger,took,a,moment,to,adjust,the,drape,of,his,cape,but,tyrion,had,seen,the,flash,of,hunger,in,those,sly,cat,s,eyes,[END]
i,have,him,he,knew,[END]
harrenhal,is,cursed,lord,petyr,said,after,a,moment,trying,to,sound,bored,[END]
then,raze,it,to,the,ground,and,build,anew,to,suit,yourself,[END]
you,ll,have,no,lack,of,coin,[END]
i,mean,to,make,you,liege,lord,of,the,trident,[END]
these,river,lords,have,proven,they,cannot,be,trusted,[END]
let,them,do,you,fealty,for,their,lands,[END]
even,the,tullys,[END]
if,there,are,any,tullys,left,when,we,are,done,[END]
littlefinger,looked,like,a,boy,who,had,just,taken,a,furtive,bite,from,a,honeycomb,[END]
he,was,trying,to,watch,for,bees,but,the,honey,was,so,sweet,[END]
harrenhal,and,all,its,lands,and,incomes,he,mused,[END]
with,a,stroke,you,d,make,me,one,of,the,greatest,lords,in,the,realm,[END]
not,that,i,m,ungrateful,my,lord,but,why,[END]
you,served,my,sister,well,in,the,matter,of,the,succession,[END]
as,did,janos,slynt,[END]
on,whom,this,same,castle,of,harrenhal,was,quite,recently,bestowed,only,to,be,snatched,away,when,he,was,no,longer,of,use,[END]
tyrion,laughed,[END]
you,have,me,my,lord,[END]
what,can,i,say,[END]
i,need,you,to,deliver,the,lady,lysa,[END]
i,did,not,need,janos,slynt,he,gave,a,crooked,shrug,[END]
i,d,sooner,have,you,seated,in,harrenhal,than,renly,seated,on,the,iron,throne,[END]
what,could,be,plainer,[END]
what,indeed,[END]
you,realize,that,i,may,need,to,bed,lysa,arryn,again,to,get,her,consent,to,this,marriage,[END]
i,have,little,doubt,you,ll,be,equal,to,the,task,[END]
i,once,told,ned,stark,that,when,you,find,yourself,naked,with,an,ugly,woman,the,only,thing,to,do,is,close,your,eyes,and,get,on,with,it,littlefinger,steepled,his,fingers,and,gazed,into,tyrion,s,mismatched,eyes,[END]
give,me,a,fortnight,to,conclude,my,affairs,and,arrange,for,a,ship,to,carry,me,to,gulltown,[END]
that,will,do,nicely,[END]
his,guest,rose,[END]
this,has,been,quite,the,pleasant,morning,lannister,[END]
and,profitable,[END]
for,both,of,us,i,trust,he,bowed,his,cape,a,swirl,of,yellow,as,he,strode,out,the,door,[END]
two,thought,tyrion,[END]
he,went,up,to,his,bedchamber,to,await,varys,who,would,soon,be,making,an,appearance,[END]
evenfall,he,guessed,[END]
perhaps,as,late,as,moonrise,though,he,hoped,not,[END]
he,hoped,to,visit,shae,tonight,[END]
he,was,pleasantly,surprised,when,galt,of,the,stone,crows,informed,him,not,an,hour,later,that,the,powdered,man,was,at,his,door,[END]
you,are,a,cruel,man,to,make,the,grand,maester,squirm,so,the,eunuch,scolded,[END]
the,man,cannot,abide,a,secret,[END]
is,that,a,crow,i,hear,calling,the,raven,black,[END]
or,would,you,sooner,not,hear,what,i,ve,proposed,to,doran,martell,[END]
varys,giggled,[END]
perhaps,my,little,birds,have,told,me,[END]
have,they,indeed,he,wanted,to,hear,this,[END]
go,on,[END]
the,dornishmen,thus,far,have,held,aloof,from,these,wars,[END]
doran,martell,has,called,his,banners,but,no,more,[END]
his,hatred,for,house,lannister,is,well,known,and,it,is,commonly,thought,he,will,join,lord,renly,[END]
you,wish,to,dissuade,him,[END]
all,this,is,obvious,said,tyrion,[END]
the,only,puzzle,is,what,you,might,have,offered,for,his,allegiance,[END]
the,prince,is,a,sentimental,man,and,he,still,mourns,his,sister,elia,and,her,sweet,babe,[END]
my,father,once,told,me,that,a,lord,never,lets,sentiment,get,in,the,way,of,ambition,[END]
and,it,happens,we,have,an,empty,seat,on,the,small,council,now,that,lord,janos,has,taken,the,black,[END]
a,council,seat,is,not,to,be,despised,varys,admitted,yet,will,it,be,enough,to,make,a,proud,man,forget,his,sister,s,murder,[END]
why,forget,tyrion,smiled,[END]
i,ve,promised,to,deliver,his,sister,s,killers,alive,or,dead,as,he,prefers,[END]
after,the,war,is,done,to,be,sure,[END]
varys,gave,him,a,shrewd,look,[END]
my,little,birds,tell,me,that,princess,elia,cried,a,[END]
certain,name,[END]
when,they,came,for,her,[END]
is,a,secret,still,a,secret,if,everyone,knows,it,in,casterly,rock,it,was,common,knowledge,that,gregor,clegane,had,killed,elia,and,her,babe,[END]
they,said,he,had,raped,the,princess,with,her,son,s,blood,and,brains,still,on,his,hands,[END]
this,secret,is,your,lord,father,s,sworn,man,[END]
my,father,would,be,the,first,to,tell,you,that,fifty,thousand,dornishmen,are,worth,one,rabid,dog,[END]
varys,stroked,a,powdered,cheek,[END]
and,if,prince,doran,demands,the,blood,of,the,lord,who,gave,the,command,as,well,as,the,knight,who,did,the,deed,[END]
robert,baratheon,led,the,rebellion,[END]
all,commands,came,from,him,in,the,end,[END]
robert,was,not,at,king,s,landing,[END]
neither,was,doran,martell,[END]
so,[END]
blood,for,his,pride,a,chair,for,his,ambition,[END]
gold,and,land,that,goes,without,saying,[END]
a,sweet,offer,[END]
yet,sweets,can,be,poisoned,[END]
if,i,were,the,prince,something,more,would,i,require,before,i,should,reach,for,this,honeycomb,[END]
some,token,of,good,faith,some,sure,safeguard,against,betrayal,varys,smiled,his,slimiest,smile,[END]
which,one,will,you,give,him,i,wonder,[END]
tyrion,sighed,[END]
you,know,don,t,you,[END]
since,you,put,it,that,way,yes,[END]
tommen,[END]
you,could,scarcely,offer,myrcella,to,doran,martell,and,lysa,arryn,both,[END]
remind,me,never,to,play,these,guessing,games,with,you,again,[END]
you,cheat,[END]
prince,tommen,is,a,good,boy,[END]
if,i,pry,him,away,from,cersei,and,joffrey,while,he,s,still,young,he,may,even,grow,to,be,a,good,man,[END]
and,a,good,king,[END]
joffrey,is,king,[END]
and,tommen,is,heir,should,anything,ill,befall,his,grace,[END]
tommen,whose,nature,is,so,sweet,and,notably,[END]
tractable,[END]
you,have,a,suspicious,mind,varys,[END]
i,shall,take,that,as,a,tribute,my,lord,[END]
in,any,case,prince,doran,will,hardly,be,insensible,of,the,great,honor,you,do,him,[END]
very,deftly,done,i,would,say,[END]
but,for,one,small,flaw,[END]
the,dwarf,laughed,[END]
named,cersei,[END]
what,avails,statecraft,against,the,love,of,a,mother,for,the,sweet,fruit,of,her,womb,[END]
perhaps,for,the,glory,of,her,house,and,the,safety,of,the,realm,the,queen,might,be,persuaded,to,send,away,tommen,or,myrcella,[END]
but,both,of,them,[END]
surely,not,[END]
what,cersei,does,not,know,will,never,hurt,me,[END]
and,if,her,grace,were,to,discover,your,intentions,before,your,plans,are,ripe,[END]
why,he,said,then,i,would,know,the,man,who,told,her,to,be,my,certain,enemy,and,when,varys,giggled,he,thought,three,[END]
sansa,[END]
come,to,the,godswood,tonight,if,you,want,to,go,home,[END]
the,words,were,the,same,on,the,hundredth,reading,as,they,d,been,on,the,first,when,sansa,had,discovered,the,folded,sheet,of,parchment,beneath,her,pillow,[END]
she,did,not,know,how,it,had,gotten,there,or,who,had,sent,it,[END]
the,note,was,unsigned,unsealed,and,the,hand,unfamiliar,[END]
she,crushed,the,parchment,to,her,chest,and,whispered,the,words,to,herself,[END]
come,to,the,godswood,tonight,if,you,want,to,go,home,she,breathed,ever,so,faintly,[END]
what,could,it,mean,[END]
should,she,take,it,to,the,queen,to,prove,that,she,was,being,good,[END]
nervously,she,rubbed,her,stomach,[END]
the,angry,purple,bruise,ser,meryn,had,given,her,had,faded,to,an,ugly,yellow,but,still,hurt,[END]
his,fist,had,been,mailed,when,he,hit,her,[END]
it,was,her,own,fault,[END]
she,must,learn,to,hide,her,feelings,better,so,as,not,to,anger,joffrey,[END]
when,she,heard,that,the,imp,had,sent,lord,slynt,to,the,wall,she,had,forgotten,herself,and,said,i,hope,the,others,get,him,the,king,had,not,been,pleased,[END]
come,to,the,godswood,tonight,if,you,want,to,go,home,[END]
sansa,had,prayed,so,hard,[END]
could,this,be,her,answer,at,last,a,true,knight,sent,to,save,her,[END]
perhaps,it,was,one,of,the,redwyne,twins,or,bold,ser,balon,swann,[END]
or,even,beric,dondarrion,the,young,lord,her,friend,jeyne,poole,had,loved,with,his,red-gold,hair,and,the,spray,of,stars,on,his,black,cloak,[END]
come,to,the,godswood,tonight,if,you,want,to,go,home,[END]
what,if,it,was,some,cruel,jape,of,joffrey,s,like,the,day,he,had,taken,her,up,to,the,battlements,to,show,her,father,s,head,[END]
or,perhaps,it,was,some,subtle,snare,to,prove,she,was,not,loyal,[END]
if,she,went,to,the,godswood,would,she,find,ser,ilyn,payne,waiting,for,her,sitting,silent,under,the,heart,tree,with,ice,in,his,hand,his,pale,eyes,watching,to,see,if,she,d,come,[END]

had,she,put,it,under,the,pillow,[END]
it,did,not,seem,likely,she,seemed,a,stupid,girl,not,one,you,d,want,delivering,secret,notes,but,sansa,did,not,know,her,[END]
the,queen,had,her,servants,changed,every,fortnight,to,make,certain,none,of,them,befriended,her,[END]
when,a,fire,was,blazing,in,the,hearth,sansa,thanked,the,maid,curtly,and,ordered,her,out,[END]
the,girl,was,quick,to,obey,as,ever,but,sansa,decided,there,was,something,sly,about,her,eyes,[END]
doubtless,she,was,scurrying,off,to,report,to,the,queen,or,maybe,varys,[END]
all,her,maids,spied,on,her,she,was,certain,[END]

from,his,height,it,could,only,be,ser,preston,greenfield,[END]
the,queen,had,given,her,freedom,of,the,castle,but,even,so,he,would,want,to,know,where,she,was,going,if,she,tried,to,leave,maegor,s,holdfast,at,this,time,of,night,[END]
what,was,she,to,tell,him,[END]
suddenly,she,was,glad,she,had,burned,the,note,[END]
she,unlaced,her,gown,and,crawled,into,her,bed,but,she,did,not,sleep,[END]
was,he,still,there,[END]
she,wondered,[END]
how,long,will,he,wait,[END]
it,was,so,cruel,to,send,her,a,note,and,tell,her,nothing,[END]
the,thoughts,went,round,and,round,in,her,head,[END]
if,only,she,had,someone,to,tell,her,what,to,do,[END]

well,this,village,was,no,winterfell,but,those,thatched,roofs,promised,warmth,and,shelter,and,maybe,even,food,if,they,were,bold,enough,to,risk,them,[END]
unless,it,s,lorch,there,[END]
he,had,horses,he,would,have,traveled,faster,than,us,[END]
she,watched,from,the,tree,for,a,long,time,hoping,she,might,see,something,a,man,a,horse,a,banner,anything,that,would,help,her,know,[END]
a,few,times,she,glimpsed,motion,but,the,buildings,were,so,far,off,it,was,hard,to,be,certain,[END]
once,very,clearly,she,heard,the,whinny,of,a,horse,[END]
the,air,was,full,of,birds,crows,mostly,[END]
from,afar,they,were,no,larger,than,flies,as,they,wheeled,and,flapped,above,the,thatched,roofs,[END]
to,the,east,gods,eye,was,a,sheet,of,sun-hammered,blue,that,filled,half,the,world,[END]
some,days,as,they,made,their,slow,way,up,the,muddy,shore,gendry,wanted,no,part,of,any,roads,and,even,hot,pie,and,lommy,saw,the,sense,in,that,arya,felt,as,though,the,lake,were,calling,her,[END]
she,wanted,to,leap,into,those,placid,blue,waters,to,feel,clean,again,to,swim,and,splash,and,bask,in,the,sun,[END]
but,she,dare,not,take,off,her,clothes,where,the,others,could,see,not,even,to,wash,them,[END]
at,the,end,of,the,day,she,would,often,sit,on,a,rock,and,dangle,her,feet,in,the,cool,water,[END]
she,had,finally,thrown,away,her,cracked,and,rotted,shoes,[END]
walking,barefoot,was,hard,at,first,but,the,blisters,had,finally,broken,the,cuts,had,healed,and,her,soles,had,turned,to,leather,[END]
the,mud,was,nice,between,her,toes,and,she,liked,to,feel,the,earth,underfoot,when,she,walked,[END]
from,up,here,she,could,see,a,small,wooded,island,off,to,the,northeast,[END]
thirty,yards,from,shore,three,black,swans,were,gliding,over,the,water,so,serene,[END]
no,one,had,told,them,that,war,had,come,and,they,cared,nothing,for,burning,towns,and,butchered,men,[END]
she,stared,at,them,with,yearning,[END]
part,of,her,wanted,to,be,a,swan,[END]
the,other,part,wanted,to,eat,one,[END]
she,had,broken,her,fast,on,some,acorn,paste,and,a,handful,of,bugs,[END]
bugs,weren,t,so,bad,when,you,got,used,to,them,[END]
worms,were,worse,but,still,not,as,bad,as,the,pain,in,your,belly,after,days,without,food,[END]
finding,bugs,was,easy,all,you,had,to,do,was,kick,over,a,rock,[END]
arya,had,eaten,a,bug,once,when,she,was,little,just,to,make,sansa,screech,so,she,hadn,t,been,afraid,to,eat,another,[END]

yesterday,gendry,had,caught,a,frog,and,shared,it,with,lommy,and,a,few,days,before,hot,pie,had,found,blackberries,and,stripped,the,bush,bare,but,mostly,they,had,been,living,on,water,and,acorns,[END]
kurz,had,told,them,how,to,use,rocks,and,make,a,kind,of,acorn,paste,[END]
it,tasted,awful,[END]
she,wished,the,poacher,hadn,t,died,[END]
he,d,known,more,about,the,woods,than,all,the,rest,of,them,together,but,he,d,taken,an,arrow,through,the,shoulder,pulling,in,the,ladder,at,the,towerhouse,[END]
tarber,had,packed,it,with,mud,and,moss,from,the,lake,and,for,a,day,or,two,kurz,swore,the,wound,was,nothing,even,though,the,flesh,of,his,throat,was,turning,dark,while,angry,red,welts,crept,up,his,jaw,and,down,his,chest,[END]
then,one,morning,he,couldn,t,find,the,strength,to,get,up,and,by,the,next,he,was,dead,[END]
they,buried,him,under,a,mound,of,stones,and,cutjack,had,claimed,his,sword,and,hunting,horn,while,tarber,helped,himself,to,bow,and,boots,and,knife,[END]
they,d,taken,it,all,when,they,left,[END]
at,first,they,thought,the,two,had,just,gone,hunting,that,they,d,soon,return,with,game,and,feed,them,all,[END]
but,they,waited,and,waited,until,finally,gendry,made,them,move,on,[END]
maybe,tarber,and,cutjack,figured,they,would,stand,a,better,chance,without,a,gaggle,of,orphan,boys,to,herd,along,[END]
they,probably,would,too,but,that,didn,t,stop,her,hating,them,for,leaving,[END]
beneath,her,tree,hot,pie,barked,like,a,dog,[END]

hot,pie,s,bird,calls,were,awful,[END]
his,dog,was,better,but,not,much,[END]

the,bark,was,rough,beneath,her,fingers,against,her,toes,[END]

dead,man,s,stink,that,s,what,it,is,[END]
she,had,smelled,it,before,with,yoren,and,the,others,[END]
a,dense,thicket,of,brambles,grew,south,of,the,village,[END]
by,the,time,she,reached,it,the,long,shadows,of,sunset,had,begun,to,fade,and,the,lantern,bugs,were,coming,out,[END]
she,could,see,thatched,roofs,just,beyond,the,hedge,[END]
she,crept,along,until,she,found,a,gap,and,squirmed,through,on,her,belly,keeping,well,hidden,until,she,saw,what,made,the,smell,[END]
beside,the,gently,lapping,waters,of,gods,eye,a,long,gibbet,of,raw,green,wood,had,been,thrown,up,and,things,that,had,once,been,men,dangled,there,their,feet,in,chains,while,crows,pecked,at,their,flesh,and,flapped,from,corpse,to,corpse,[END]
for,every,crow,there,were,a,hundred,flies,[END]
when,the,wind,blew,off,the,lake,the,nearest,corpse,twisted,on,its,chain,ever,so,slightly,[END]
the,crows,had,eaten,most,of,its,face,and,something,else,had,been,at,it,as,well,something,much,larger,[END]
throat,and,chest,had,been,torn,apart,and,glistening,green,entrails,and,ribbons,of,ragged,flesh,dangled,from,where,the,belly,had,been,opened,[END]
one,arm,had,been,ripped,right,off,the,shoulder,arya,saw,the,bones,a,few,feet,away,gnawed,and,cracked,picked,clean,of,meat,[END]
she,made,herself,look,at,the,next,man,and,the,one,beyond,him,and,the,one,beyond,him,telling,herself,she,was,hard,as,a,stone,[END]
corpses,all,so,savaged,and,decayed,that,it,took,her,a,moment,to,realize,they,had,been,stripped,before,they,were,hanged,[END]
they,did,not,look,like,naked,people,they,hardly,looked,like,people,at,all,[END]
the,crows,had,eaten,their,eyes,and,sometimes,their,faces,[END]
of,the,sixth,in,the,long,row,nothing,remained,but,a,single,leg,still,tangled,in,its,chains,swaying,with,each,breeze,[END]
fear,cuts,deeper,than,swords,[END]
dead,men,could,not,hurt,her,but,whoever,had,killed,them,could,[END]
well,beyond,the,gibbet,two,men,in,mail,hauberks,stood,leaning,on,their,spears,in,front,of,the,long,low,building,by,the,water,the,one,with,the,slate,roof,[END]
a,pair,of,tall,poles,had,been,driven,into,the,muddy,ground,in,front,of,it,banners,drooping,from,each,staff,[END]
one,looked,red,and,one,paler,white,or,yellow,maybe,but,both,were,limp,and,with,the,dusk,settling,she,could,not,even,be,certain,that,red,one,was,lannister,crimson,[END]
i,don,t,need,to,see,the,lion,i,can,see,all,the,dead,people,who,else,would,it,be,but,lannisters,[END]
then,there,was,a,shout,[END]
the,two,spearmen,turned,at,the,cry,and,a,third,man,came,into,view,shoving,a,captive,before,him,[END]
it,was,growing,too,dark,to,make,out,faces,but,the,prisoner,was,wearing,a,shiny,steel,helm,and,when,arya,saw,the,horns,she,knew,it,was,gendry,[END]
you,stupid,stupid,stupid,stupid,[END]
she,thought,[END]
if,he,d,been,here,she,would,have,kicked,him,again,[END]
the,guards,were,talking,loudly,but,she,was,too,far,away,to,make,out,the,words,especially,with,the,crows,gabbling,and,flapping,closer,to,hand,[END]
one,of,the,spearmen,snatched,the,helm,off,gendry,s,head,and,asked,him,a,question,but,he,must,not,have,liked,the,answer,because,he,smashed,him,across,the,face,with,the,butt,of,his,spear,and,knocked,him,down,[END]
the,one,who,d,captured,him,gave,him,a,kick,while,the,second,spearman,was,trying,on,the,bull,s-head,helm,[END]
finally,they,pulled,him,to,his,feet,and,marched,him,off,toward,the,storehouse,[END]
when,they,opened,the,heavy,wooden,doors,a,small,boy,darted,out,but,one,of,the,guards,grabbed,his,arm,and,flung,him,back,inside,[END]
arya,heard,sobbing,from,inside,the,building,and,then,a,shriek,so,loud,and,full,of,pain,that,it,made,her,bite,her,lip,[END]
the,guards,shoved,gendry,inside,with,the,boy,and,barred,the,doors,behind,them,[END]
just,then,a,breath,of,wind,came,sighing,off,the,lake,and,the,banners,stirred,and,lifted,[END]
the,one,on,the,tall,staff,bore,the,golden,lion,as,she,d,feared,[END]
on,the,other,three,sleek,black,shapes,ran,across,a,field,as,yellow,as,butter,[END]
dogs,she,thought,[END]
arya,had,seen,those,dogs,before,but,where,[END]
it,didn,t,matter,[END]
the,only,thing,that,mattered,was,that,they,had,gendry,[END]
even,if,he,was,stubborn,and,stupid,she,had,to,get,him,out,[END]
she,wondered,if,they,knew,that,the,queen,wanted,him,[END]
one,of,the,guards,took,off,his,helm,and,donned,gendry,s,instead,[END]
it,made,her,angry,to,see,him,wearing,it,but,she,knew,there,was,nothing,she,could,do,to,stop,him,[END]
she,thought,she,heard,more,screams,from,inside,the,windowless,storehouse,muffled,by,the,masonry,but,it,was,hard,to,be,certain,[END]
she,stayed,long,enough,to,see,the,guard,changed,and,much,more,besides,[END]
men,came,and,went,[END]
they,led,their,horses,down,to,the,stream,to,drink,[END]
a,hunting,party,returned,from,the,wood,carrying,a,deer,s,carcass,slung,from,a,pole,[END]
she,watched,them,clean,and,gut,it,and,build,a,cookfire,on,the,far,side,of,the,stream,and,the,smell,of,cooking,meat,mingled,queerly,with,the,stench,of,corruption,[END]
her,empty,belly,roiled,and,she,thought,she,might,retch,[END]
the,prospect,of,food,brought,other,men,out,of,the,houses,near,all,of,them,wearing,bits,of,mail,or,boiled,leather,[END]
when,the,deer,was,cooked,the,choicest,portions,were,carried,to,one,of,the,houses,[END]
she,thought,that,the,dark,might,let,her,crawl,close,and,free,gendry,but,the,guards,kindled,torches,off,the,cookfire,[END]
a,squire,brought,meat,and,bread,to,the,two,guarding,the,storehouse,and,later,two,more,men,joined,them,and,they,all,passed,a,skin,of,wine,from,hand,to,hand,[END]
when,it,was,empty,the,others,left,but,the,two,guards,remained,leaning,on,their,spears,[END]
arya,s,arms,and,legs,were,stiff,when,she,finally,wriggled,out,from,under,the,briar,into,the,dark,of,the,wood,[END]
it,was,a,black,night,with,a,thin,sliver,of,moon,appearing,and,disappearing,as,the,clouds,blew,past,[END]
silent,as,a,shadow,she,told,herself,as,she,moved,through,the,trees,[END]
in,this,darkness,she,dared,not,run,for,fear,of,tripping,on,some,unseen,root,or,losing,her,way,[END]
on,her,left,gods,eye,lapped,calmly,against,its,shores,[END]
on,her,right,a,wind,sighed,through,the,branches,and,leaves,rustled,and,stirred,[END]
far,off,she,heard,the,howling,of,wolves,[END]
lommy,and,hot,pie,almost,shit,themselves,when,she,stepped,out,of,the,trees,behind,them,[END]
quiet,she,told,them,putting,an,arm,around,weasel,when,the,little,girl,came,running,up,[END]
hot,pie,stared,at,her,with,big,eyes,[END]
we,thought,you,left,us,he,had,his,shortsword,in,hand,the,one,yoren,had,taken,off,the,gold,cloak,[END]
i,was,scared,you,was,a,wolf,[END]

we,ll,sneak,up,and,kill,the,guards,and,then,i,ll,open,the,door,[END]
hot,pie,and,lommy,exchanged,a,look,[END]
how,many,[END]
i,couldn,t,count,arya,admitted,[END]
twenty,at,least,but,only,two,on,the,door,[END]
hot,pie,looked,as,if,he,were,going,to,cry,[END]
we,can,t,fight,twenty,[END]
you,only,need,to,fight,one,[END]
i,ll,do,the,other,and,we,ll,get,gendry,out,and,run,[END]
we,should,yield,lommy,said,[END]
just,go,in,and,yield,[END]
arya,shook,her,head,stubbornly,[END]
then,just,leave,him,arry,lommy,pleaded,[END]
they,don,t,know,about,the,rest,of,us,[END]
if,we,hide,they,ll,go,away,you,know,they,will,[END]
it,s,not,our,fault,gendry,s,captured,[END]
you,re,stupid,lommy,arya,said,angrily,[END]
you,ll,die,if,we,don,t,get,gendry,out,[END]
who,s,going,to,carry,you,[END]
you,and,hot,pie,[END]
all,the,time,with,no,one,else,to,help,[END]
we,ll,never,do,it,[END]
gendry,was,the,strong,one,[END]
anyhow,i,don,t,care,what,you,say,i,m,going,back,for,him,she,looked,at,hot,pie,[END]
are,you,coming,[END]
hot,pie,glanced,at,lommy,at,arya,at,lommy,again,[END]
i,ll,come,he,said,reluctantly,[END]
lommy,you,keep,weasel,here,[END]
he,grabbed,the,little,girl,by,the,hand,and,pulled,her,close,[END]
what,if,the,wolves,come,[END]
yield,arya,suggested,[END]
finding,their,way,back,to,the,village,seemed,to,take,hours,[END]
hot,pie,kept,stumbling,in,the,dark,and,losing,his,way,and,arya,had,to,wait,for,him,and,double,back,[END]
finally,she,took,him,by,the,hand,and,led,him,along,through,the,trees,[END]
just,be,quiet,and,follow,when,they,could,make,out,the,first,faint,glow,of,the,village,fires,against,the,sky,she,said,there,s,dead,men,hanging,on,the,other,side,of,the,hedge,but,they,re,nothing,to,be,scared,of,just,remember,fear,cuts,deeper,than,swords,[END]
we,have,to,go,real,quiet,and,slow,hot,pie,nodded,[END]
she,wriggled,under,the,briar,first,and,waited,for,him,on,the,far,side,crouched,low,[END]
hot,pie,emerged,pale,and,panting,face,and,arms,bloody,with,long,scratches,[END]
he,started,to,say,something,but,arya,put,a,finger,to,his,lips,[END]
on,hands,and,knees,they,crawled,along,the,gibbet,beneath,the,swaying,dead,[END]
hot,pie,never,once,looked,up,nor,made,a,sound,[END]
until,the,crow,landed,on,his,back,and,he,gave,a,muffled,gasp,[END]
who,s,there,a,voice,boomed,suddenly,from,the,dark,[END]
hot,pie,leapt,to,his,feet,[END]
i,yield,he,threw,away,his,sword,as,dozens,of,crows,rose,shrieking,and,complaining,to,flap,about,the,corpses,[END]
arya,grabbed,his,leg,and,tried,to,drag,him,back,down,but,he,wrenched,loose,and,ran,forward,waving,his,arms,[END]
i,yield,i,yield,[END]
she,bounced,up,and,drew,needle,but,by,then,men,were,all,around,her,[END]
arya,slashed,at,the,nearest,but,he,blocked,her,with,a,steel-clad,arm,and,someone,else,slammed,into,her,and,dragged,her,to,the,ground,and,a,third,man,wrenched,the,sword,from,her,grasp,[END]
when,she,tried,to,bite,her,teeth,snapped,shut,on,cold,dirty,chainmail,[END]
oho,a,fierce,one,the,man,said,laughing,[END]
the,blow,from,his,iron-clad,fist,near,knocked,her,head,off,[END]
they,talked,over,her,as,she,lay,hurting,but,arya,could,not,seem,to,understand,the,words,[END]
her,ears,rang,[END]
when,she,tried,to,crawl,off,the,earth,moved,beneath,her,[END]
they,took,needle,[END]
the,shame,of,that,hurt,worse,than,the,pain,and,the,pain,hurt,a,lot,[END]
jon,had,given,her,that,sword,[END]
syrio,had,taught,her,to,use,it,[END]
finally,someone,grabbed,the,front,of,her,jerkin,yanked,her,to,her,knees,[END]
hot,pie,was,kneeling,too,before,the,tallest,man,arya,had,ever,seen,a,monster,from,one,of,old,nan,s,stories,[END]
she,never,saw,where,the,giant,had,come,from,[END]
three,black,dogs,raced,across,his,faded,yellow,surcoat,and,his,face,looked,as,hard,as,if,it,had,been,cut,from,stone,[END]
suddenly,arya,knew,where,she,had,seen,those,dogs,before,[END]
the,night,of,the,tourney,at,king,s,landing,all,the,knights,had,hung,their,shields,outside,their,pavilions,[END]
that,one,belongs,to,the,hound,s,brother,sansa,had,confided,when,they,passed,the,black,dogs,on,the,yellow,field,[END]
he,s,even,bigger,than,hodor,you,ll,see,[END]
they,call,him,the,mountain,that,rides,[END]
arya,let,her,head,droop,only,half,aware,of,what,was,going,on,around,her,[END]
hot,pie,was,yielding,some,more,[END]
the,mountain,said,you,ll,lead,us,to,these,others,and,walked,off,[END]
next,she,was,stumbling,past,the,dead,men,on,their,gibbet,while,hot,pie,told,their,captors,he,d,bake,them,pies,and,tarts,if,they,didn,t,hurt,him,[END]
four,men,went,with,them,[END]
one,carried,a,torch,one,a,longsword,two,had,spears,[END]
they,found,lommy,where,they,d,left,him,under,the,oak,[END]
i,yield,he,called,out,at,once,when,he,saw,them,[END]
he,d,flung,away,his,own,spear,and,raised,his,hands,splotchy,green,with,old,dye,[END]
i,yield,[END]
please,[END]
the,man,with,the,torch,searched,around,under,the,trees,[END]
are,you,the,last,[END]
baker,boy,said,there,was,a,girl,[END]
she,ran,off,when,she,heard,you,coming,lommy,said,[END]
you,made,a,lot,of,noise,and,arya,thought,run,weasel,run,as,far,as,you,can,run,and,hide,and,never,come,back,[END]
tell,us,where,we,can,find,that,whoreson,dondarrion,and,there,ll,be,a,hot,meal,in,it,for,you,[END]
who,said,lommy,blankly,[END]
i,told,you,this,lot,don,t,know,no,more,than,those,cunts,in,the,village,[END]
waste,o,bloody,time,[END]
one,of,the,spearmen,drifted,over,to,lommy,[END]
something,wrong,with,your,leg,boy,[END]
it,got,hurt,[END]
can,you,walk,he,sounded,concerned,[END]
no,said,lommy,[END]
you,got,to,carry,me,[END]
think,so,the,man,lifted,his,spear,casually,and,drove,the,point,through,the,boy,s,soft,throat,[END]
lommy,never,even,had,time,to,yield,again,[END]
he,jerked,once,and,that,was,all,[END]
when,the,man,pulled,his,spear,loose,blood,sprayed,out,in,a,dark,fountain,[END]
carry,him,he,says,he,muttered,chuckling,[END]
tyrion,[END]
they,had,warned,him,to,dress,warmly,[END]
tyrion,lannister,took,them,at,their,word,[END]
he,was,garbed,in,heavy,quilted,breeches,and,a,woolen,doublet,and,over,it,all,he,had,thrown,the,shadowskin,cloak,he,had,acquired,in,the,mountains,of,the,moon,[END]
the,cloak,was,absurdly,long,made,for,a,man,twice,his,height,[END]
when,he,was,not,ahorse,the,only,way,to,wear,the,thing,was,to,wrap,it,around,him,several,times,which,made,him,look,like,a,ball,of,striped,fur,[END]
even,so,he,was,glad,he,had,listened,[END]
the,chill,in,the,long,dank,vault,went,bone,deep,[END]
timett,had,chosen,to,retreat,back,up,to,the,cellar,after,a,brief,taste,of,the,cold,below,[END]
they,were,somewhere,under,the,hill,of,rhaenys,behind,the,guildhall,of,the,alchemists,[END]
the,damp,stone,walls,were,splotchy,with,nitre,and,the,only,light,came,from,the,sealed,iron-and-glass,oil,lamp,that,hallyne,the,pyromancer,carried,so,gingerly,[END]
gingerly,indeed,[END]
and,these,would,be,the,ginger,jars,[END]
tyrion,lifted,one,for,inspection,[END]
it,was,round,and,ruddy,a,fat,clay,grapefruit,[END]
a,little,big,for,his,hand,but,it,would,fit,comfortably,in,the,grip,of,a,normal,man,he,knew,[END]
the,pottery,was,thin,so,fragile,that,even,he,had,been,warned,not,to,squeeze,too,tightly,lest,he,crush,it,in,his,fist,[END]
the,clay,felt,roughened,pebbled,[END]
hallyne,told,him,that,was,intentional,[END]
a,smooth,pot,is,more,apt,to,slip,from,a,man,s,grasp,[END]
the,wildfire,oozed,slowly,toward,the,lip,of,the,jar,when,tyrion,tilted,it,to,peer,inside,[END]
the,color,would,be,a,murky,green,he,knew,but,the,poor,light,made,that,impossible,to,confirm,[END]
thick,he,observed,[END]
that,is,from,the,cold,my,lord,said,hallyne,a,pallid,man,with,soft,damp,hands,and,an,obsequious,manner,[END]
he,was,dressed,in,striped,black-and-scarlet,robes,trimmed,with,sable,but,the,fur,looked,more,than,a,little,patchy,and,moth-eaten,[END]
as,it,warms,the,substance,will,flow,more,easily,like,lamp,oil,[END]
the,substance,was,the,pyromancers,own,term,for,wildfire,[END]
they,called,each,other,wisdom,as,well,which,tyrion,found,almost,as,annoying,as,their,custom,of,hinting,at,the,vast,secret,stores,of,knowledge,that,they,wanted,him,to,think,they,possessed,[END]
once,theirs,had,been,a,powerful,guild,but,in,recent,centuries,the,maesters,of,the,citadel,had,supplanted,the,alchemists,almost,everywhere,[END]
now,only,a,few,of,the,older,order,remained,and,they,no,longer,even,pretended,to,transmute,metals,[END]
but,they,could,make,wildfire,[END]
water,will,not,quench,it,i,am,told,[END]
that,is,so,[END]
once,it,takes,fire,the,substance,will,burn,fiercely,until,it,is,no,more,[END]
more,it,will,seep,into,cloth,wood,leather,even,steel,so,they,take,fire,as,well,[END]
tyrion,remembered,the,red,priest,thoros,of,myr,and,his,flaming,sword,[END]
even,a,thin,coating,of,wildfire,could,burn,for,an,hour,[END]
thoros,always,needed,a,new,sword,after,a,melee,but,robert,had,been,fond,of,the,man,and,ever,glad,to,provide,one,[END]
why,doesn,t,it,seep,into,the,clay,as,well,[END]
oh,but,it,does,said,hallyne,[END]
there,is,a,vault,below,this,one,where,we,store,the,older,pots,[END]
those,from,king,aerys,s,day,[END]
it,was,his,fancy,to,have,the,jars,made,in,the,shapes,of,fruits,[END]
very,perilous,fruits,indeed,my,lord,hand,and,hmmm,riper,now,than,ever,if,you,take,my,meaning,[END]
we,have,sealed,them,with,wax,and,pumped,the,lower,vault,full,of,water,but,even,so,[END]
by,rights,they,ought,to,have,been,destroyed,but,so,many,of,our,masters,were,murdered,during,the,sack,of,king,s,landing,the,few,acolytes,who,remained,were,unequal,to,the,task,[END]
and,much,of,the,stock,we,made,for,aerys,was,lost,[END]
only,last,year,two,hundred,jars,were,discovered,in,a,storeroom,beneath,the,great,sept,of,baelor,[END]
no,one,could,recall,how,they,came,there,but,i,m,sure,i,do,not,need,to,tell,you,that,the,high,septon,was,beside,himself,with,terror,[END]
i,myself,saw,that,they,were,safely,moved,[END]
i,had,a,cart,filled,with,sand,and,sent,our,most,able,acolytes,[END]
we,worked,only,by,night,we,[END]
did,a,splendid,job,i,have,no,doubt,tyrion,placed,the,jar,he,d,been,holding,back,among,its,fellows,[END]
they,covered,the,table,standing,in,orderly,rows,of,four,and,marching,away,into,the,subterranean,dimness,[END]
and,there,were,other,tables,beyond,many,other,tables,[END]
these,ah,fruits,of,the,late,king,aerys,can,they,still,be,used,[END]
oh,yes,most,certainly,[END]
but,carefully,my,lord,ever,so,carefully,[END]
as,it,ages,the,substance,grows,ever,more,hmmmm,fickle,let,us,say,[END]
any,flame,will,set,it,afire,[END]
any,spark,[END]
too,much,heat,and,jars,will,blaze,up,of,their,own,accord,[END]
it,is,not,wise,to,let,them,sit,in,sunlight,even,for,a,short,time,[END]
once,the,fire,begins,within,the,heat,causes,the,substance,to,expand,violently,and,the,jars,shortly,fly,to,pieces,[END]
if,other,jars,should,happen,to,be,stored,in,the,same,vicinity,those,go,up,as,well,and,so,[END]
how,many,jars,do,you,have,at,present,[END]
this,morning,the,wisdom,munciter,told,me,that,we,had,seven,thousand,eight,hundred,and,forty,[END]
that,count,includes,four,thousand,jars,from,king,aerys,s,day,to,be,sure,[END]
our,overripe,fruits,[END]
hallyne,bobbed,his,head,[END]
wisdom,malliard,believes,we,shall,be,able,to,provide,a,full,ten,thousand,jars,as,was,promised,the,queen,[END]
i,concur,the,pyromancer,looked,indecently,pleased,with,that,prospect,[END]
assuming,our,enemies,give,you,the,time,[END]
the,pyromancers,kept,their,recipe,for,wildfire,a,closely,guarded,secret,but,tyrion,knew,that,it,was,a,lengthy,dangerous,and,time-consuming,process,[END]
he,had,assumed,the,promise,of,ten,thousand,jars,was,a,wild,boast,like,that,of,the,bannerman,who,vows,to,marshal,ten,thousand,swords,for,his,lord,and,shows,up,on,the,day,of,battle,with,a,hundred,and,two,[END]
if,they,can,truly,give,us,ten,thousand,[END]
he,did,not,know,whether,he,ought,to,be,delighted,or,terrified,[END]

any,little,mistake,can,bring,catastrophe,[END]
that,cannot,be,said,too,often,[END]
my,father,often,told,king,aerys,as,much,as,his,father,told,old,king,jaehaerys,[END]

a,most,hmmm,loving,gesture,my,lord,[END]

a,small,demonstration,of,our,powers,as,it,were,to,distract,his,grace,from,his,many,cares,for,an,evening,[END]

the,trick,was,to,catch,the,axe,or,leap,over,it,without,missing,a,step,[END]

the,ravens,muttered,above,his,head,as,he,worked,a,strangely,peaceful,noise,[END]
he,would,need,to,find,someone,to,tend,the,birds,until,the,citadel,sent,a,man,to,replace,pycelle,[END]

varys,and,littlefinger,were,no,more,loyal,he,suspected,[END]
only,more,subtle,and,thus,more,dangerous,[END]

it,was,as,much,a,part,of,her,days,as,stale,bread,and,the,blisters,on,her,toes,after,a,long,day,of,walking,the,hard,rutted,road,[END]
she,had,thought,she,had,known,what,it,meant,to,be,afraid,but,she,learned,better,in,that,storehouse,beside,the,gods,eye,[END]
eight,days,she,had,lingered,there,before,the,mountain,gave,the,command,to,march,and,every,day,she,had,seen,someone,die,[END]

the,village,folk,would,never,look,at,him,[END]
maybe,they,thought,that,if,they,did,not,notice,him,he,would,not,notice,them,[END]
but,he,saw,them,anyway,and,picked,whom,he,liked,[END]
there,was,no,place,to,hide,no,tricks,to,play,no,way,to,be,safe,[END]

the,mountain,heard,her,out,the,next,morning,he,picked,her,daughter,to,be,certain,she,d,held,nothing,back,[END]
the,ones,chosen,were,questioned,in,full,view,of,the,other,captives,so,they,could,see,the,fate,of,rebels,and,traitors,[END]
a,man,the,others,called,the,tickler,asked,the,questions,[END]
his,face,was,so,ordinary,and,his,garb,so,plain,that,arya,might,have,thought,him,one,of,the,villagers,before,she,had,seen,him,at,his,work,[END]
tickler,makes,them,howl,so,hard,they,piss,themselves,old,stoop-shoulder,chiswyck,told,them,[END]

the,lannisters,had,taken,everything,father,friends,home,hope,courage,[END]

the,maester,s,turret,below,the,rookery,was,one,of,bran,s,favorite,places,[END]

their,wise,men,were,called,greenseers,[END]

luwin,set,down,his,quill,[END]
no,one,truly,knows,bran,[END]
the,children,are,gone,from,the,world,and,their,wisdom,with,them,[END]
it,had,to,do,with,the,faces,in,the,trees,we,think,[END]
the,first,men,believed,that,the,greenseers,could,see,through,the,eyes,of,the,weirwoods,[END]
that,was,why,they,cut,down,the,trees,whenever,they,warred,upon,the,children,[END]
supposedly,the,greenseers,also,had,power,over,the,beasts,of,the,wood,and,the,birds,in,the,trees,[END]

do,you,perchance,recall,what,i,taught,you,about,the,chain,collar,that,every,maester,wears,[END]
bran,thought,for,a,moment,trying,to,remember,[END]
a,maester,forges,his,chain,in,the,citadel,of,oldtown,[END]
it,s,a,chain,because,you,swear,to,serve,and,it,s,made,of,different,metals,because,you,serve,the,realm,and,the,realm,has,different,sorts,of,people,[END]
every,time,you,learn,something,you,get,another,link,[END]
black,iron,is,for,ravenry,silver,for,healing,gold,for,sums,and,numbers,[END]
i,don,t,remember,them,all,[END]
luwin,slid,a,finger,up,under,his,collar,and,began,to,turn,it,inch,by,inch,[END]
he,had,a,thick,neck,for,a,small,man,and,the,chain,was,tight,but,a,few,pulls,had,it,all,the,way,around,[END]
this,is,valyrian,steel,he,said,when,the,link,of,dark,grey,metal,lay,against,the,apple,of,his,throat,[END]
only,one,maester,in,a,hundred,wears,such,a,link,[END]
this,signifies,that,i,have,studied,what,the,citadel,calls,the,higher,mysteries,magic,for,want,of,a,better,word,[END]
a,fascinating,pursuit,but,of,small,use,which,is,why,so,few,maesters,trouble,themselves,with,it,[END]
all,those,who,study,the,higher,mysteries,try,their,own,hand,at,spells,soon,or,late,[END]
i,yielded,to,the,temptation,too,i,must,confess,it,[END]
well,i,was,a,boy,and,what,boy,does,not,secretly,wish,to,find,hidden,powers,in,himself,[END]
i,got,no,more,for,my,efforts,than,a,thousand,boys,before,me,and,a,thousand,since,[END]
sad,to,say,magic,does,not,work,[END]
sometimes,it,does,bran,protested,[END]
i,had,that,dream,and,rickon,did,too,[END]
and,there,are,mages,and,warlocks,in,the,east,[END]
there,are,men,who,call,themselves,mages,and,warlocks,maester,luwin,said,[END]
i,had,a,friend,at,the,citadel,who,could,pull,a,rose,out,of,your,ear,but,he,was,no,more,magical,than,i,was,[END]
oh,to,be,sure,there,is,much,we,do,not,understand,[END]
the,years,pass,in,their,hundreds,and,their,thousands,and,what,does,any,man,see,of,life,but,a,few,summers,a,few,winters,[END]
we,look,at,mountains,and,call,them,eternal,and,so,they,seem,[END]

even,gods,die,we,think,[END]
everything,changes,[END]
perhaps,magic,was,once,a,mighty,force,in,the,world,but,no,longer,[END]
what,little,remains,is,no,more,than,the,wisp,of,smoke,that,lingers,in,the,air,after,a,great,fire,has,burned,out,and,even,that,is,fading,[END]

ser,lancel,made,a,stiff,bow,and,took,his,leave,[END]
tyrion,allowed,himself,a,moment,to,feel,sorry,for,the,boy,[END]
another,fool,and,a,weakling,as,well,but,he,does,not,deserve,what,cersei,and,i,are,doing,to,him,[END]
it,was,a,kindness,that,his,uncle,kevan,had,two,other,sons,this,one,was,unlikely,to,live,out,the,year,[END]
cersei,would,have,him,killed,out,of,hand,if,she,learned,he,was,betraying,her,and,if,by,some,grace,of,the,gods,she,did,not,lancel,would,never,survive,the,day,jaime,lannister,returned,to,king,s,landing,[END]
the,only,question,would,be,whether,jaime,cut,him,down,in,a,jealous,rage,or,cersei,murdered,him,first,to,keep,jaime,from,finding,out,[END]
tyrion,s,silver,was,on,cersei,[END]
a,restlessness,was,on,him,and,tyrion,knew,full,well,he,would,not,get,back,to,sleep,tonight,[END]
not,here,in,any,case,[END]
he,found,podrick,payne,asleep,in,a,chair,outside,the,door,of,the,solar,and,shook,him,by,the,shoulder,[END]
summon,bronn,and,then,run,down,to,the,stables,and,have,two,horses,saddled,[END]
the,squire,s,eyes,were,cloudy,with,sleep,[END]
horses,[END]
those,big,brown,animals,that,love,apples,i,m,sure,you,ve,seen,them,[END]
four,legs,and,a,tail,[END]
but,bronn,first,[END]
the,sellsword,was,not,long,in,appearing,[END]
who,pissed,in,your,soup,he,demanded,[END]
cersei,as,ever,[END]
you,d,think,i,d,be,used,to,the,taste,by,now,but,never,mind,[END]
my,gentle,sister,seems,to,have,mistaken,me,for,ned,stark,[END]
i,hear,he,was,taller,[END]
not,after,joff,took,off,his,head,[END]
you,ought,to,have,dressed,more,warmly,the,night,is,chill,[END]
are,we,going,somewhere,[END]
are,all,sellswords,as,clever,as,you,[END]
the,city,streets,were,dangerous,but,with,bronn,beside,him,tyrion,felt,safe,enough,[END]
the,guards,let,him,out,a,postern,gate,in,the,north,wall,and,they,rode,down,shadowblack,lane,to,the,foot,of,aegon,s,high,hill,and,thence,onto,pigrun,alley,past,rows,of,shuttered,windows,and,tall,timber-and-stone,buildings,whose,upper,stories,leaned,out,so,far,over,the,street,they,almost,kissed,[END]
the,moon,seemed,to,follow,them,as,they,went,playing,peek-and-sneak,among,the,chimneys,[END]
they,encountered,no,one,but,a,lone,old,crone,carrying,a,dead,cat,by,the,tail,[END]
she,gave,them,a,fearful,look,as,if,she,were,afraid,they,might,try,to,steal,her,dinner,and,slunk,off,into,the,shadows,without,a,word,[END]
tyrion,reflected,on,the,men,who,had,been,hand,before,him,who,had,proved,no,match,for,his,sister,s,wiles,[END]
how,could,they,be,[END]
men,like,that,[END]
too,honest,to,live,too,noble,to,shit,cersei,devours,such,fools,every,morning,when,she,breaks,her,fast,[END]
the,only,way,to,defeat,my,sister,is,to,play,her,own,game,and,that,was,something,the,lords,stark,and,arryn,would,never,do,[END]
small,wonder,that,both,of,them,were,dead,while,tyrion,lannister,had,never,felt,more,alive,[END]
his,stunted,legs,might,make,him,a,comic,grotesque,at,a,harvest,ball,but,this,dance,he,knew,[END]
despite,the,hour,the,brothel,was,crowded,[END]
chataya,greeted,them,pleasantly,and,escorted,them,to,the,common,room,[END]
bronn,went,upstairs,with,a,dark-eyed,girl,from,dorne,but,alayaya,was,busy,entertaining,[END]
she,will,be,so,pleased,to,know,you,ve,come,said,chataya,[END]
i,will,see,that,the,turret,room,is,made,ready,for,you,[END]
will,my,lord,take,a,cup,of,wine,while,he,waits,[END]
i,will,he,said,[END]
the,wine,was,poor,stuff,compared,to,the,vintages,from,the,arbor,the,house,normally,served,[END]
you,must,forgive,us,my,lord,chataya,said,[END]
i,cannot,find,good,wine,at,any,price,of,late,[END]
you,are,not,alone,in,that,i,fear,[END]
chataya,commiserated,with,him,a,moment,then,excused,herself,and,glided,off,[END]
a,handsome,woman,tyrion,reflected,as,he,watched,her,go,[END]
he,had,seldom,seen,such,elegance,and,dignity,in,a,whore,[END]
though,to,be,sure,she,saw,herself,more,as,a,kind,of,priestess,[END]
perhaps,that,is,the,secret,[END]
it,is,not,what,we,do,so,much,as,why,we,do,it,[END]
somehow,that,thought,comforted,him,[END]
a,few,of,the,other,patrons,were,giving,him,sideways,looks,[END]
the,last,time,he,ventured,out,a,man,had,spit,on,him,[END]
well,had,tried,to,[END]
instead,he,d,spit,on,bronn,and,in,future,would,do,his,spitting,without,teeth,[END]
is,milord,feeling,unloved,dancy,slid,into,his,lap,and,nibbled,at,his,ear,[END]
i,have,a,cure,for,that,[END]
smiling,tyrion,shook,his,head,[END]
you,are,too,beautiful,for,words,sweetling,but,i,ve,grown,fond,of,alayaya,s,remedy,[END]
you,ve,never,tried,mine,[END]
milord,never,chooses,anyone,but,yaya,[END]
she,s,good,but,i,m,better,don,t,you,want,to,see,[END]
next,time,perhaps,tyrion,had,no,doubt,that,dancy,would,be,a,lively,handful,[END]
she,was,pug-nosed,and,bouncy,with,freckles,and,a,mane,of,thick,red,hair,that,tumbled,down,past,her,waist,[END]
but,he,had,shae,waiting,for,him,at,the,manse,[END]
giggling,she,put,her,hand,between,his,thighs,and,squeezed,him,through,his,breeches,[END]
i,don,t,think,he,wants,to,wait,till,next,time,she,announced,[END]
he,wants,to,come,out,and,count,all,my,freckles,i,think,[END]
dancy,alayaya,stood,in,the,doorway,dark,and,cool,in,gauzy,green,silk,[END]
his,lordship,is,come,to,visit,me,[END]
tyrion,gently,disentangled,himself,from,the,other,girl,and,stood,[END]
dancy,did,not,seem,to,mind,[END]
next,time,she,reminded,him,[END]
she,put,a,finger,in,her,mouth,and,sucked,it,[END]
as,the,black-skinned,girl,led,him,up,the,stairs,she,said,poor,dancy,[END]
she,has,a,fortnight,to,get,my,lord,to,choose,her,[END]
elsewise,she,loses,her,black,pearls,to,marei,[END]
marei,was,a,cool,pale,delicate,girl,tyrion,had,noticed,once,or,twice,[END]
green,eyes,and,porcelain,skin,long,straight,silvery,hair,very,lovely,but,too,solemn,by,half,[END]
i,d,hate,to,have,the,poor,child,lose,her,pearls,on,account,of,me,[END]
then,take,her,upstairs,next,time,[END]
maybe,i,will,[END]
she,smiled,[END]
i,think,not,my,lord,[END]
she,s,right,tyrion,thought,i,won,t,[END]
shae,may,be,only,a,whore,but,i,am,faithful,to,her,after,my,fashion,[END]
in,the,turret,room,as,he,opened,the,door,of,the,wardrobe,he,looked,at,alayaya,curiously,[END]
what,do,you,do,while,i,m,gone,[END]
she,raised,her,arms,and,stretched,like,some,sleek,black,cat,[END]
sleep,[END]
i,am,much,better,rested,since,you,began,to,visit,us,my,lord,[END]
and,marei,is,teaching,us,to,read,perhaps,soon,i,will,be,able,to,pass,the,time,with,a,book,[END]
sleep,is,good,he,said,[END]
and,books,are,better,he,gave,her,a,quick,kiss,on,the,cheek,[END]
then,it,was,down,the,shaft,and,through,the,tunnel,[END]
as,he,left,the,stable,on,his,piebald,gelding,tyrion,heard,the,sound,of,music,drifting,over,the,rooftops,[END]
it,was,pleasant,to,think,that,men,still,sang,even,in,the,midst,of,butchery,and,famine,[END]
remembered,notes,filled,his,head,and,for,a,moment,he,could,almost,hear,tysha,as,she,d,sung,to,him,half,a,lifetime,ago,[END]
he,reined,up,to,listen,[END]
the,tune,was,wrong,the,words,too,faint,to,hear,[END]
a,different,song,then,and,why,not,[END]
his,sweet,innocent,tysha,had,been,a,lie,start,to,finish,only,a,whore,his,brother,jaime,had,hired,to,make,him,a,man,[END]
i,m,free,of,tysha,now,he,thought,[END]
she,s,haunted,me,half,my,life,but,i,don,t,need,her,anymore,no,more,than,i,need,alayaya,or,dancy,or,marei,or,the,hundreds,like,them,i,ve,bedded,with,over,the,years,[END]
i,have,shae,now,[END]
shae,[END]
the,gates,of,the,manse,were,closed,and,barred,[END]
tyrion,pounded,until,the,ornate,bronze,eye,clacked,open,[END]
it,s,me,the,man,who,admitted,him,was,one,of,varys,s,prettier,finds,a,braavosi,daggerman,with,a,harelip,and,a,lazy,eye,[END]
tyrion,had,wanted,no,handsome,young,guardsmen,loitering,about,shae,day,after,day,[END]
find,me,old,ugly,scarred,men,preferably,impotent,he,had,told,the,eunuch,[END]
men,who,prefer,boys,[END]
or,men,who,prefer,sheep,for,that,matter,varys,had,not,managed,to,come,up,with,any,sheeplovers,but,he,did,find,a,eunuch,strangler,and,a,pair,of,foul-smelling,ibbenese,who,were,as,fond,of,axes,as,they,were,of,each,other,[END]
the,others,were,as,choice,a,lot,of,mercenaries,as,ever,graced,a,dungeon,each,uglier,than,the,last,[END]
when,varys,had,paraded,them,before,him,tyrion,had,been,afraid,he,d,gone,too,far,but,shae,had,never,uttered,a,word,of,complaint,[END]
and,why,would,she,[END]
she,has,never,complained,of,me,and,i,m,more,hideous,than,all,her,guards,together,[END]
perhaps,she,does,not,even,see,ugliness,[END]
even,so,tyrion,would,sooner,have,used,some,of,his,mountain,clansmen,to,guard,the,manse,chella,s,black,ears,perhaps,or,the,moon,brothers,[END]
he,had,more,faith,in,their,iron,loyalties,and,sense,of,honor,than,in,the,greed,of,sellswords,[END]
the,risk,was,too,great,however,[END]
all,king,s,landing,knew,the,wildlings,were,his,[END]
if,he,sent,the,black,ears,here,it,would,only,be,a,matter,of,time,until,the,whole,city,knew,the,king,s,hand,was,keeping,a,concubine,[END]
one,of,the,ibbenese,took,his,horse,[END]
have,you,woken,her,tyrion,asked,him,[END]
no,m,lord,[END]
good,[END]
the,fire,in,the,bedchamber,had,burned,down,to,embers,but,the,room,was,still,warm,[END]
shae,had,kicked,off,her,blankets,and,sheets,as,she,slept,[END]
she,lay,nude,atop,the,featherbed,the,soft,curves,of,her,young,body,limned,in,the,faint,glow,from,the,hearth,[END]
tyrion,stood,in,the,door,and,drank,in,the,sight,of,her,[END]
younger,than,marei,sweeter,than,dancy,more,beautiful,than,alayaya,she,s,all,i,need,and,more,[END]
how,could,a,whore,look,so,clean,and,sweet,and,innocent,he,wondered,[END]
he,had,not,intended,to,disturb,her,but,the,sight,of,her,was,enough,to,make,him,hard,[END]
he,let,his,garments,fall,to,the,floor,then,crawled,onto,the,bed,and,gently,pushed,her,legs,apart,and,kissed,her,between,the,thighs,[END]
shae,murmured,in,her,sleep,[END]
he,kissed,her,again,and,licked,at,her,secret,sweetness,on,and,on,until,his,beard,and,her,cunt,were,both,soaked,[END]
when,she,gave,a,soft,moan,and,shuddered,he,climbed,up,and,thrust,himself,inside,her,and,exploded,almost,at,once,[END]
her,eyes,were,open,[END]
she,smiled,and,stroked,his,head,and,whispered,i,just,had,the,sweetest,dream,m,lord,[END]
tyrion,nipped,at,her,small,hard,nipple,and,nestled,his,head,on,her,shoulder,[END]
he,did,not,pull,out,of,her,would,that,he,never,had,to,pull,out,of,her,[END]
this,is,no,dream,he,promised,her,[END]
it,is,real,all,of,it,he,thought,the,wars,the,intrigues,the,great,bloody,game,and,me,in,the,center,of,it,[END]
me,the,dwarf,the,monster,the,one,they,scorned,and,laughed,at,but,now,i,hold,it,all,the,power,the,city,the,girl,[END]
this,was,what,i,was,made,for,and,gods,forgive,me,but,i,do,love,it,[END]
and,her,[END]
and,her,[END]
arya,[END]
whatever,names,harren,the,black,had,meant,to,give,his,towers,were,long,forgotten,[END]
they,were,called,the,tower,of,dread,the,widow,s,tower,the,wailing,tower,the,tower,of,ghosts,and,kingspyre,tower,[END]
arya,slept,in,a,shallow,niche,in,the,cavernous,vaults,beneath,the,wailing,tower,on,a,bed,of,straw,[END]
she,had,water,to,wash,in,whenever,she,liked,a,chunk,of,soap,[END]
the,work,was,hard,but,no,harder,than,walking,miles,every,day,[END]
weasel,did,not,need,to,find,worms,and,bugs,to,eat,as,arry,had,there,was,bread,every,day,and,barley,stews,with,bits,of,carrot,and,turnip,and,once,a,fortnight,even,a,bite,of,meat,[END]
hot,pie,ate,even,better,he,was,where,he,belonged,in,the,kitchens,a,round,stone,building,with,a,domed,roof,that,was,a,world,unto,itself,[END]
arya,took,her,meals,at,a,trestle,table,in,the,undercroft,with,weese,and,his,other,charges,but,sometimes,she,would,be,chosen,to,help,fetch,their,food,and,she,and,hot,pie,could,steal,a,moment,to,talk,[END]
he,could,never,remember,that,she,was,now,weasel,and,kept,calling,her,arry,even,though,he,knew,she,was,a,girl,[END]
once,he,tried,to,slip,her,a,hot,apple,tart,but,he,made,such,a,clumsy,job,of,it,that,two,of,the,cooks,saw,[END]
they,took,the,tart,away,and,beat,him,with,a,big,wooden,spoon,[END]
gendry,had,been,sent,to,the,forge,arya,seldom,saw,him,[END]
as,for,those,she,served,with,she,did,not,even,want,to,know,their,names,[END]
that,only,made,it,hurt,worse,when,they,died,[END]
most,of,them,were,older,than,she,was,and,content,to,let,her,alone,[END]
harrenhal,was,vast,much,of,it,far,gone,in,decay,[END]
lady,whent,had,held,the,castle,as,bannerman,to,house,tully,but,she,d,used,only,the,lower,thirds,of,two,of,the,five,towers,and,let,the,rest,go,to,ruin,[END]
now,she,was,fled,and,the,small,household,she,d,left,could,not,begin,to,tend,the,needs,of,all,the,knights,lords,and,highborn,prisoners,lord,tywin,had,brought,so,the,lannisters,must,forage,for,servants,as,well,as,for,plunder,and,provender,[END]
the,talk,was,that,lord,tywin,planned,to,restore,harrenhal,to,glory,and,make,it,his,new,seat,once,the,war,was,done,[END]
weese,used,arya,to,run,messages,draw,water,and,fetch,food,and,sometimes,to,serve,at,table,in,the,barracks,hall,above,the,armory,where,the,men-at-arms,took,their,meals,[END]
but,most,of,her,work,was,cleaning,[END]
the,ground,floor,of,the,wailing,tower,was,given,over,to,storerooms,and,granaries,and,two,floors,above,housed,part,of,the,garrison,but,the,upper,stories,had,not,been,occupied,for,eighty,years,[END]
now,lord,tywin,had,commanded,that,they,be,made,fit,for,habitation,again,[END]
there,were,floors,to,be,scrubbed,grime,to,be,washed,off,windows,broken,chairs,and,rotted,beds,to,be,carried,off,[END]
the,topmost,story,was,infested,with,nests,of,the,huge,black,bats,that,house,whent,had,used,for,its,sigil,and,there,were,rats,in,the,cellars,as,well,[END]
and,ghosts,some,said,the,spirits,of,harren,the,black,and,his,sons,[END]
arya,thought,that,was,stupid,[END]
harren,and,his,sons,had,died,in,kingspyre,tower,that,was,why,it,had,that,name,so,why,should,they,cross,the,yard,to,haunt,her,[END]
the,wailing,tower,only,wailed,when,the,wind,blew,from,the,north,and,that,was,just,the,sound,the,air,made,blowing,through,the,cracks,in,the,stones,where,they,had,fissured,from,the,heat,[END]
if,there,were,ghosts,in,harrenhal,they,never,troubled,her,[END]
it,was,the,living,men,she,feared,weese,and,ser,gregor,clegane,and,lord,tywin,lannister,himself,who,kept,his,apartments,in,kingspyre,tower,still,the,tallest,and,mightiest,of,all,though,lopsided,beneath,the,weight,of,the,slagged,stone,that,made,it,look,like,some,giant,half-melted,black,candle,[END]
she,wondered,what,lord,tywin,would,do,if,she,marched,up,to,him,and,confessed,to,being,arya,stark,but,she,knew,she,d,never,get,near,enough,to,talk,to,him,and,anyhow,he,d,never,believe,her,if,she,did,and,afterward,weese,would,beat,her,bloody,[END]
in,his,own,small,strutting,way,weese,was,nearly,as,scary,as,ser,gregor,[END]

have,you,been,to,our,markets,of,late,lord,varys,asked,littlefinger,[END]

win,him,and,highgarden,will,be,yours,[END]
yes,tyrion,thought,[END]
it,seems,to,me,we,should,take,a,lesson,from,the,late,lord,renly,[END]
we,can,win,the,tyrell,alliance,as,he,did,[END]
with,a,marriage,[END]
varys,understood,the,quickest,[END]
you,think,to,wed,king,joffrey,to,margaery,tyrell,[END]
i,do,renly,s,young,queen,was,no,more,than,fifteen,sixteen,he,seemed,to,recall,[END]
older,than,joffrey,but,a,few,years,were,nothing,it,was,so,neat,and,sweet,he,could,taste,it,[END]
joffrey,is,betrothed,to,sansa,stark,cersei,objected,[END]
marriage,contracts,can,be,broken,[END]
what,advantage,is,there,in,wedding,the,king,to,the,daughter,of,a,dead,traitor,[END]
littlefinger,spoke,up,[END]
you,might,point,out,to,his,grace,that,the,tyrells,are,much,wealthier,than,the,starks,and,that,margaery,is,said,to,be,lovely,[END]
and,beddable,besides,[END]
yes,said,tyrion,joff,ought,to,like,that,well,enough,[END]
my,son,is,too,young,to,care,about,such,things,[END]
you,think,so,asked,tyrion,[END]
he,s,thirteen,cersei,[END]
the,same,age,at,which,i,married,[END]
you,shamed,us,all,with,that,sorry,episode,[END]
joffrey,is,made,of,finer,stuff,[END]
so,fine,that,he,had,ser,boros,rip,off,sansa,s,gown,[END]
he,was,angry,with,the,girl,[END]
he,was,angry,with,that,cook,s,boy,who,spilled,the,soup,last,night,as,well,but,he,didn,t,strip,him,naked,[END]
this,was,not,a,matter,of,some,spilled,soup,[END]
no,it,was,a,matter,of,some,pretty,teats,[END]
after,that,business,in,the,yard,tyrion,had,spoken,with,varys,about,how,they,might,arrange,for,joffrey,to,visit,chataya,s,[END]
a,taste,of,honey,might,sweeten,the,boy,he,hoped,[END]
he,might,even,be,grateful,gods,forbid,and,tyrion,could,do,with,a,shade,more,gratitude,from,his,sovereign,[END]
it,would,need,to,be,done,secretly,of,course,[END]
the,tricky,bit,would,be,parting,him,from,the,hound,[END]
the,dog,is,never,far,from,his,master,s,heels,he,d,observed,to,varys,but,all,men,sleep,[END]
and,some,gamble,and,whore,and,visit,winesinks,as,well,[END]
the,hound,does,all,these,things,if,that,is,your,question,[END]
no,said,tyrion,[END]
my,question,is,when,[END]
varys,had,laid,a,finger,on,his,cheek,smiling,enigmatically,[END]
my,lord,a,suspicious,man,might,think,you,wished,to,find,a,time,when,sandor,clegane,was,not,protecting,king,joffrey,the,better,to,do,the,boy,some,harm,[END]
surely,you,know,me,better,than,that,lord,varys,tyrion,said,[END]
why,all,i,want,is,for,joffrey,to,love,me,[END]
the,eunuch,had,promised,to,look,into,the,matter,[END]
the,war,made,its,own,demands,though,joffrey,s,initiation,into,manhood,would,need,to,wait,[END]
doubtless,you,know,your,son,better,than,i,do,he,made,himself,tell,cersei,but,regardless,there,s,still,much,to,be,said,for,a,tyrell,marriage,[END]
it,may,be,the,only,way,that,joffrey,lives,long,enough,to,reach,his,wedding,night,[END]
littlefinger,agreed,[END]
the,stark,girl,brings,joffrey,nothing,but,her,body,sweet,as,that,may,be,[END]
margaery,tyrell,brings,fifty,thousand,swords,and,all,the,strength,of,highgarden,[END]
indeed,varys,laid,a,soft,hand,on,the,queen,s,sleeve,[END]
you,have,a,mother,s,heart,and,i,know,his,grace,loves,his,little,sweetling,[END]
yet,kings,must,learn,to,put,the,needs,of,the,realm,before,their,own,desires,[END]
i,say,this,offer,must,be,made,[END]
the,queen,pulled,free,of,the,eunuch,s,touch,[END]
you,would,not,speak,so,if,you,were,women,[END]
say,what,you,will,my,lords,but,joffrey,is,too,proud,to,settle,for,renly,s,leavings,[END]
he,will,never,consent,[END]
tyrion,shrugged,[END]
when,the,king,comes,of,age,in,three,years,he,may,give,or,withhold,his,consent,as,he,pleases,[END]
until,then,you,are,his,regent,and,i,am,his,hand,and,he,will,marry,whomever,we,tell,him,to,marry,[END]
leavings,or,no,[END]

i,m,so,pleased,we,can,agree,tyrion,said,[END]
now,which,of,us,shall,go,to,bitterbridge,[END]
we,must,reach,ser,loras,with,our,offer,before,his,blood,can,cool,[END]
you,mean,to,send,one,of,the,council,[END]
i,can,scarcely,expect,the,knight,of,flowers,to,treat,with,bronn,or,shagga,can,i,[END]
the,tyrells,are,proud,[END]
his,sister,wasted,no,time,trying,to,twist,the,situation,to,her,advantage,[END]
ser,jacelyn,bywater,is,nobly,born,[END]
send,him,[END]
tyrion,shook,his,head,[END]
we,need,someone,who,can,do,more,than,repeat,our,words,and,fetch,back,a,reply,[END]
our,envoy,must,speak,for,king,and,council,and,settle,the,matter,quickly,[END]
the,hand,speaks,with,the,king,s,voice,candlelight,gleamed,green,as,wildfire,in,cersei,s,eyes,[END]
if,we,send,you,tyrion,it,will,be,as,if,joffrey,went,himself,[END]
and,who,better,[END]
you,wield,words,as,skillfully,as,jaime,wields,a,sword,[END]
are,you,that,eager,to,get,me,out,of,the,city,cersei,[END]
you,are,too,kind,sister,but,it,seems,to,me,that,a,boy,s,mother,is,better,fitted,to,arrange,his,marriage,than,any,uncle,[END]
and,you,have,a,gift,for,winning,friends,that,i,could,never,hope,to,match,[END]
her,eyes,narrowed,[END]
joff,needs,me,at,his,side,[END]
your,grace,my,lord,hand,said,littlefinger,the,king,needs,both,of,you,here,[END]
let,me,go,in,your,stead,[END]
you,what,gain,does,he,see,in,this,[END]
tyrion,wondered,[END]
i,am,of,the,king,s,council,yet,not,the,king,s,blood,so,i,would,make,a,poor,hostage,[END]
i,knew,ser,loras,passing,well,when,he,was,here,at,court,and,gave,him,no,cause,to,mislike,me,[END]
mace,tyrell,bears,me,no,enmity,that,i,know,of,and,i,flatter,myself,that,i,am,not,unskilled,in,negotiation,[END]
he,has,us,[END]
tyrion,did,not,trust,petyr,baelish,nor,did,he,want,the,man,out,of,his,sight,yet,what,other,choice,was,left,him,[END]
it,must,be,littlefinger,or,tyrion,himself,and,he,knew,full,well,that,if,he,left,king,s,landing,for,any,length,of,time,all,that,he,had,managed,to,accomplish,would,be,undone,[END]
there,is,fighting,between,here,and,bitterbridge,he,said,cautiously,[END]
and,you,can,be,past,certain,that,lord,stannis,will,be,dispatching,his,own,shepherds,to,gather,in,his,brother,s,wayward,lambs,[END]
i,ve,never,been,frightened,of,shepherds,[END]
it,s,the,sheep,who,trouble,me,[END]
still,i,suppose,an,escort,might,be,in,order,[END]
i,can,spare,a,hundred,gold,cloaks,tyrion,said,[END]
five,hundred,[END]
three,hundred,[END]
and,forty,more,twenty,knights,with,as,many,squires,[END]
if,i,arrive,without,a,knightly,tail,the,tyrells,will,think,me,of,small,account,[END]
that,was,true,enough,[END]
agreed,[END]
i,ll,include,horror,and,slobber,in,my,party,and,send,them,on,to,their,lord,father,afterward,[END]
a,gesture,of,goodwill,[END]
we,need,paxter,redwyne,he,s,mace,tyrell,s,oldest,friend,and,a,great,power,in,his,own,right,[END]
and,a,traitor,the,queen,said,balking,[END]
the,arbor,would,have,declared,for,renly,with,all,the,rest,except,that,redwyne,knew,full,well,his,whelps,would,suffer,for,it,[END]
renly,is,dead,your,grace,littlefinger,pointed,out,and,neither,stannis,nor,lord,paxter,will,have,forgotten,how,redwyne,galleys,closed,the,sea,during,the,siege,of,storm,s,end,[END]
restore,the,twins,and,perchance,we,may,win,redwyne,s,love,[END]
cersei,remained,unconvinced,[END]
the,others,can,keep,his,love,i,want,his,swords,and,sails,[END]
holding,tight,to,those,twins,is,the,best,way,to,make,certain,that,we,ll,have,them,[END]
tyrion,had,the,answer,[END]
then,let,us,send,ser,hobber,back,to,the,arbor,and,keep,ser,horas,here,[END]
lord,paxter,ought,to,be,clever,enough,to,riddle,out,the,meaning,of,that,i,should,think,[END]

that,i,had,[END]
you,were,innocent,[END]
even,so,you,did,not,have,to,do,that,[END]

that,you,will,not,hold,me,back,from,stannis,[END]
catelyn,could,still,hear,stannis,saying,that,robb,s,turn,too,would,come,in,time,[END]
it,was,like,a,cold,breath,on,the,back,of,her,neck,[END]
when,the,time,comes,i,will,not,hold,you,back,[END]
the,tall,girl,knelt,awkwardly,unsheathed,renly,s,longsword,and,laid,it,at,her,feet,[END]

how,many,times,did,i,watch,ned,accept,a,man,s,oath,of,service,[END]
she,wondered,what,he,would,think,if,he,could,see,her,now,[END]

slow,and,careful,like,milady,he,warned,as,he,took,the,bridle,of,her,horse,[END]

the,realization,gave,her,a,queasy,feeling,in,the,bowels,but,she,held,her,tongue,[END]
between,the,red,fork,and,the,tumblestone,they,joined,a,stream,of,smallfolk,making,for,the,safety,of,riverrun,[END]
some,were,driving,animals,before,them,others,pulling,wayns,but,they,made,way,as,catelyn,rode,past,and,cheered,her,with,cries,of,tully,or,stark,half,a,mile,from,the,castle,she,passed,through,a,large,encampment,where,the,scarlet,banner,of,the,blackwoods,waved,above,the,lord,s,tent,[END]

the,gold,that,she,had,squandered,to,open,the,doors,of,the,hall,of,a,thousand,thrones,was,largely,a,product,of,the,merchant,s,generosity,and,quick,wits,[END]

to,be,sure,her,smile,was,a,shade,tremulous,when,her,brothers,took,their,leave,of,her,on,the,deck,of,the,seaswift,but,the,girl,knew,the,proper,words,to,say,and,she,said,them,with,courage,and,dignity,[END]
when,the,time,came,to,part,it,was,prince,tommen,who,cried,and,myrcella,who,gave,him,comfort,[END]

lionstar,bold,wind,and,lady,lyanna,would,sail,with,her,as,well,[END]
it,made,tyrion,more,than,a,little,uneasy,to,detach,so,great,a,part,of,their,already,inadequate,fleet,depleted,as,it,was,by,the,loss,of,all,those,ships,that,had,sailed,with,lord,stannis,to,dragonstone,and,never,returned,but,cersei,would,hear,of,nothing,less,[END]
perhaps,she,was,wise,[END]

once,myrcella,was,safe,in,braavos,he,had,pledged,to,move,his,strength,to,the,high,passes,where,the,threat,might,make,some,of,the,marcher,lords,rethink,their,loyalties,and,give,stannis,pause,about,marching,north,[END]
it,was,purely,a,feint,however,[END]
the,martells,would,not,commit,to,actual,battle,unless,dorne,itself,was,attacked,and,stannis,was,not,so,great,a,fool,[END]

sunlight,caught,in,his,crystal,crown,and,spilled,rainbows,across,myrcella,s,upturned,face,[END]

these,were,no,onion,knights,but,proud,men,from,houses,whose,names,were,old,in,honor,[END]

you,have,every,right,to,reproach,me,ser,davos,[END]
you,reproach,yourself,more,than,i,ever,could,your,grace,[END]

i,have,often,wondered,[END]
they,remind,me,of,what,i,was,[END]
where,i,came,from,[END]
they,remind,me,of,your,justice,my,liege,[END]
it,was,justice,stannis,said,[END]
a,good,act,does,not,wash,out,the,bad,nor,a,bad,act,the,good,[END]
each,should,have,its,own,reward,[END]
you,were,a,hero,and,a,smuggler,he,glanced,behind,at,lord,florent,and,the,others,rainbow,knights,and,turncloaks,who,were,following,at,a,distance,[END]
these,pardoned,lords,would,do,well,to,reflect,on,that,[END]

a,northman,might,even,say,the,same,of,robb,stark,[END]
but,these,lords,who,flocked,to,my,brother,s,banners,knew,him,for,a,usurper,[END]
they,turned,their,backs,on,their,rightful,king,for,no,better,reason,than,dreams,of,power,and,glory,and,i,have,marked,them,for,what,they,are,[END]
pardoned,them,yes,[END]
forgiven,[END]
but,not,forgotten,he,fell,silent,for,a,moment,brooding,on,his,plans,for,justice,[END]
and,then,abruptly,he,said,what,do,the,smallfolk,say,of,renly,s,death,[END]
they,grieve,[END]
your,brother,was,well,loved,[END]
fools,love,a,fool,grumbled,stannis,but,i,grieve,for,him,as,well,[END]
for,the,boy,he,was,not,the,man,he,grew,to,be,he,was,silent,for,a,time,and,then,he,said,how,did,the,commons,take,the,news,of,cersei,s,incest,[END]
while,we,were,among,them,they,shouted,for,king,stannis,[END]
i,cannot,speak,for,what,they,said,once,we,had,sailed,[END]
so,you,do,not,think,they,believed,[END]
when,i,was,smuggling,i,learned,that,some,men,believe,everything,and,some,nothing,[END]
we,met,both,sorts,[END]
and,there,is,another,tale,being,spread,as,well,[END]

selyse,has,given,me,horns,and,tied,a,fool,s,bells,to,the,end,of,each,[END]
my,daughter,fathered,by,a,halfwit,jester,[END]
a,tale,as,vile,as,it,is,absurd,[END]
renly,threw,it,in,my,teeth,when,we,met,to,parley,[END]
you,would,need,to,be,as,mad,as,patchface,to,believe,such,a,thing,[END]
that,may,be,so,my,liege,[END]

if,someone,said,i,had,magicked,myself,into,a,boar,to,kill,robert,likely,they,would,believe,that,as,well,[END]
you,cannot,stop,them,talking,my,liege,davos,said,but,when,you,take,your,vengeance,on,your,brothers,true,killers,the,realm,will,know,such,tales,for,lies,[END]
stannis,only,seemed,to,half,hear,him,[END]
i,have,no,doubt,that,cersei,had,a,hand,in,robert,s,death,[END]
i,will,have,justice,for,him,[END]

and,for,renly,the,words,were,out,before,davos,could,stop,to,consider,them,[END]
for,a,long,time,the,king,did,not,speak,[END]
then,very,softly,he,said,i,dream,of,it,sometimes,[END]
of,renly,s,dying,[END]
a,green,tent,candles,a,woman,screaming,[END]
and,blood,stannis,looked,down,at,his,hands,[END]

it,was,a,dream,[END]
i,was,in,my,tent,when,renly,died,and,when,i,woke,my,hands,were,clean,[END]
ser,davos,seaworth,could,feel,his,phantom,fingertips,start,to,itch,[END]
something,is,wrong,here,the,onetime,smuggler,thought,[END]
yet,he,nodded,and,said,i,see,[END]
renly,offered,me,a,peach,[END]
at,our,parley,[END]
mocked,me,defied,me,threatened,me,and,offered,me,a,peach,[END]
i,thought,he,was,drawing,a,blade,and,went,for,mine,own,[END]
was,that,his,purpose,to,make,me,show,fear,[END]
or,was,it,one,of,his,pointless,jests,[END]
when,he,spoke,of,how,sweet,the,peach,was,did,his,words,have,some,hidden,meaning,the,king,gave,a,shake,of,his,head,like,a,dog,shaking,a,rabbit,to,snap,its,neck,[END]
only,renly,could,vex,me,so,with,a,piece,of,fruit,[END]
he,brought,his,doom,on,himself,with,his,treason,but,i,did,love,him,davos,[END]
i,know,that,now,[END]
i,swear,i,will,go,to,my,grave,thinking,of,my,brother,s,peach,[END]
by,then,they,were,in,amongst,the,camp,riding,past,the,ordered,rows,of,tents,the,blowing,banners,and,the,stacks,of,shields,and,spears,[END]
the,stink,of,horse,dung,was,heavy,in,the,air,mingled,with,the,woodsmoke,and,the,smell,of,cooking,meat,[END]

they,bowed,their,heads,and,dispersed,while,davos,and,melisandre,rode,to,the,king,s,pavilion,[END]
the,tent,had,to,be,large,since,it,was,there,his,lords,bannermen,came,to,council,[END]
yet,there,was,nothing,grand,about,it,[END]
it,was,a,soldier,s,tent,of,heavy,canvas,dyed,the,dark,yellow,that,sometimes,passed,for,gold,[END]
only,the,royal,banner,that,streamed,atop,the,center,pole,marked,it,as,a,king,s,[END]
that,and,the,guards,without,queen,s,men,leaning,on,tall,spears,with,the,badge,of,the,fiery,heart,sewn,over,their,own,[END]

one,of,the,guards,relieved,melisandre,of,her,cumbersome,standard,driving,the,staff,deep,into,the,soft,ground,[END]

yet,they,require,me,to,make,them,true,he,thought,[END]
it,had,been,a,long,time,since,davos,seaworth,felt,so,sad,[END]
and,so,it,was,that,he,found,himself,once,more,crossing,shipbreaker,bay,in,the,dark,of,night,steering,a,tiny,boat,with,a,black,sail,[END]
the,sky,was,the,same,and,the,sea,[END]
the,same,salt,smell,was,in,the,air,and,the,water,chuckling,against,the,hull,was,just,as,he,remembered,it,[END]
a,thousand,flickering,campfires,burned,around,the,castle,as,the,fires,of,the,tyrells,and,redwynes,had,sixteen,years,before,[END]

sixteen,years,ago,the,sails,had,cracked,and,snapped,with,every,shift,of,wind,until,he,d,pulled,them,down,and,gone,on,with,muffled,oars,[END]

this,time,the,only,ships,in,sight,belonged,to,stannis,and,the,only,danger,would,come,from,watchers,on,the,castle,walls,[END]
even,so,davos,was,taut,as,a,bowstring,[END]
melisandre,huddled,upon,a,thwart,lost,in,the,folds,of,a,dark,red,cloak,that,covered,her,from,head,to,heels,her,face,a,paleness,beneath,the,cowl,[END]
davos,loved,the,water,[END]
he,slept,best,when,he,had,a,deck,rocking,beneath,him,and,the,sighing,of,the,wind,in,his,rigging,was,a,sweeter,sound,to,him,than,any,a,singer,could,make,with,his,harp,strings,[END]
even,the,sea,brought,him,no,comfort,tonight,though,[END]

your,hand,raised,the,sail,[END]
your,hand,holds,the,tiller,[END]

the,fires,behind,them,had,melted,into,one,vague,glow,against,the,black,sky,and,the,land,was,almost,out,of,sight,[END]
it,was,time,to,come,about,[END]
watch,your,head,my,lady,he,pushed,on,the,tiller,and,the,small,boat,threw,up,a,curl,of,black,water,as,she,turned,[END]

the,endless,crash,of,wave,on,rock,was,the,only,sound,that,ever,penetrated,the,massive,seaward,walls,of,storm,s,end,and,that,but,faintly,[END]
a,rippling,wake,spread,out,behind,as,they,swung,back,toward,the,shore,[END]
you,speak,of,men,and,onions,davos,said,to,melisandre,[END]

the,god,of,darkness,protects,us,now,my,lady,[END]

together,they,tied,off,the,sail,as,the,boat,rocked,beneath,them,[END]
as,davos,unshipped,the,oars,and,slid,them,into,the,choppy,black,water,he,said,who,rowed,you,to,renly,[END]
there,was,no,need,she,said,[END]
he,was,unprotected,[END]
but,here,[END]
this,storm,s,end,is,an,old,place,[END]
there,are,spells,woven,into,the,stones,[END]
dark,walls,that,no,shadow,can,pass,ancient,forgotten,yet,still,in,place,[END]
shadow,davos,felt,his,flesh,prickling,[END]
a,shadow,is,a,thing,of,darkness,[END]
you,are,more,ignorant,than,a,child,ser,knight,[END]
there,are,no,shadows,in,the,dark,[END]
shadows,are,the,servants,of,light,the,children,of,fire,[END]
the,brightest,flame,casts,the,darkest,shadows,[END]
frowning,davos,hushed,her,then,[END]
they,were,coming,close,to,shore,once,more,and,voices,carried,across,the,water,[END]
he,rowed,the,faint,sound,of,his,oars,lost,in,the,rhythm,of,the,waves,[END]
the,seaward,side,of,storm,s,end,perched,upon,a,pale,white,cliff,the,chalky,stone,sloping,up,steeply,to,half,again,the,height,of,the,massive,curtain,wall,[END]
a,mouth,yawned,in,the,cliff,and,it,was,that,davos,steered,for,as,he,had,sixteen,years,before,[END]
the,tunnel,opened,on,a,cavern,under,the,castle,where,the,storm,lords,of,old,had,built,their,landing,[END]
the,passage,was,navigable,only,during,high,tide,and,was,never,less,than,treacherous,but,his,smuggler,s,skills,had,not,deserted,him,[END]
davos,threaded,their,way,deftly,between,the,jagged,rocks,until,the,cave,mouth,loomed,up,before,them,[END]
he,let,the,waves,carry,them,inside,[END]
they,crashed,around,him,slamming,the,boat,this,way,and,that,and,soaking,them,to,the,skin,[END]
a,half-seen,finger,of,rock,came,rushing,up,out,of,the,gloom,snarling,foam,and,davos,barely,kept,them,off,it,with,an,oar,[END]
then,they,were,past,engulfed,in,darkness,and,the,waters,smoothed,[END]
the,little,boat,slowed,and,swirled,[END]
the,sound,of,their,breathing,echoed,until,it,seemed,to,surround,them,[END]
davos,had,not,expected,the,blackness,[END]
the,last,time,torches,had,burned,all,along,the,tunnel,and,the,eyes,of,starving,men,had,peered,down,through,the,murder,holes,in,the,ceiling,[END]
the,portcullis,was,somewhere,ahead,he,knew,[END]
davos,used,the,oars,to,slow,them,and,they,drifted,against,it,almost,gently,[END]
this,is,as,far,as,we,go,unless,you,have,a,man,inside,to,lift,the,gate,for,us,his,whispers,scurried,across,the,lapping,water,like,a,line,of,mice,on,soft,pink,feet,[END]
have,we,passed,within,the,walls,[END]
yes,[END]
beneath,[END]
but,we,can,go,no,farther,[END]
the,portcullis,goes,all,the,way,to,the,bottom,[END]
and,the,bars,are,too,closely,spaced,for,even,a,child,to,squeeze,through,[END]
there,was,no,answer,but,a,soft,rustling,[END]
and,then,a,light,bloomed,amidst,the,darkness,[END]
davos,raised,a,hand,to,shield,his,eyes,and,his,breath,caught,in,his,throat,[END]
melisandre,had,thrown,back,her,cowl,and,shrugged,out,of,the,smothering,robe,[END]
beneath,she,was,naked,and,huge,with,child,[END]
swollen,breasts,hung,heavy,against,her,chest,and,her,belly,bulged,as,if,near,to,bursting,[END]
gods,preserve,us,he,whispered,and,heard,her,answering,laugh,deep,and,throaty,[END]
her,eyes,were,hot,coals,and,the,sweat,that,dappled,her,skin,seemed,to,glow,with,a,light,of,its,own,[END]
melisandre,shone,[END]
panting,she,squatted,and,spread,her,legs,[END]
blood,ran,down,her,thighs,black,as,ink,[END]
her,cry,might,have,been,agony,or,ecstasy,or,both,[END]
and,davos,saw,the,crown,of,the,child,s,head,push,its,way,out,of,her,[END]
two,arms,wriggled,free,grasping,black,fingers,coiling,around,melisandre,s,straining,thighs,pushing,until,the,whole,of,the,shadow,slid,out,into,the,world,and,rose,taller,than,davos,tall,as,the,tunnel,towering,above,the,boat,[END]
he,had,only,an,instant,to,look,at,it,before,it,was,gone,twisting,between,the,bars,of,the,portcullis,and,racing,across,the,surface,of,the,water,but,that,instant,was,long,enough,[END]
he,knew,that,shadow,[END]
as,he,knew,the,man,who,d,cast,it,[END]
jon,[END]
the,call,came,drifting,through,the,black,of,night,[END]
jon,pushed,himself,onto,an,elbow,his,hand,reaching,for,longclaw,by,force,of,habit,as,the,camp,began,to,stir,[END]
the,horn,that,wakes,the,sleepers,he,thought,[END]
the,long,low,note,lingered,at,the,edge,of,hearing,[END]
the,sentries,at,the,ringwall,stood,still,in,their,footsteps,breath,frosting,and,heads,turned,toward,the,west,[END]
as,the,sound,of,the,horn,faded,even,the,wind,ceased,to,blow,[END]
men,rolled,from,their,blankets,and,reached,for,spears,and,swordbelts,moving,quietly,listening,[END]
a,horse,whickered,and,was,hushed,[END]
for,a,heartbeat,it,seemed,as,if,the,whole,forest,were,holding,its,breath,[END]
the,brothers,of,the,night,s,watch,waited,for,a,second,blast,praying,they,should,not,hear,it,fearing,that,they,would,[END]
when,the,silence,had,stretched,unbearably,long,and,the,men,knew,at,last,that,the,horn,would,not,wind,again,they,grinned,at,one,another,sheepishly,as,if,to,deny,that,they,had,been,anxious,[END]

i,will,do,as,my,lord,commands,of,course,[END]
but,i,must,warn,you,the,kitchens,are,full,of,eyes,and,ears,[END]
even,if,the,girl,falls,under,no,particular,suspicion,she,will,be,subject,to,a,thousand,questions,[END]
where,was,she,born,[END]
who,were,her,parents,[END]
how,did,she,come,to,king,s,landing,[END]
the,truth,will,never,do,so,she,must,lie,[END]

i,d,sooner,have,her,fondled,than,stabbed,said,tyrion,[END]
varys,rode,on,a,few,paces,and,said,it,might,be,that,there,is,another,way,[END]
as,it,happens,the,maidservant,who,attends,lady,tanda,s,daughter,has,been,filching,her,jewels,[END]
were,i,to,inform,lady,tanda,she,would,be,forced,to,dismiss,the,girl,at,once,[END]

a,lady,s,bedmaid,wore,finer,garb,than,a,scullion,and,often,even,a,jewel,or,two,[END]

she,was,not,like,to,pay,them,any,friendly,calls,[END]
lollys,is,timid,and,trusting,varys,said,[END]
she,will,accept,any,tale,she,is,told,[END]
since,the,mob,took,her,maidenhood,she,is,afraid,to,leave,her,chambers,so,shae,will,be,out,of,sight,[END]

chataya,s,is,not,the,only,house,to,boast,a,hidden,door,[END]
a,secret,access,[END]
to,my,chambers,tyrion,was,more,annoyed,than,surprised,[END]
why,else,would,maegor,the,cruel,have,ordered,death,for,all,the,builders,who,had,worked,on,his,castle,except,to,preserve,such,secrets,[END]
yes,i,suppose,there,would,be,[END]
where,will,i,find,the,door,[END]
in,my,solar,[END]
my,bedchamber,[END]
my,friend,you,would,not,force,me,to,reveal,all,my,little,secrets,would,you,[END]
henceforth,think,of,them,as,our,little,secrets,varys,tyrion,glanced,up,at,the,eunuch,in,his,smelly,mummer,s,garb,[END]
assuming,you,are,on,my,side,[END]
can,you,doubt,it,[END]
why,no,i,trust,you,implicitly,a,bitter,laugh,echoed,off,the,shuttered,windows,[END]
i,trust,you,like,one,of,my,own,blood,in,truth,[END]
now,tell,me,how,cortnay,penrose,died,[END]
it,is,said,that,he,threw,himself,from,a,tower,[END]
threw,himself,[END]
no,i,will,not,believe,that,[END]
his,guards,saw,no,man,enter,his,chambers,nor,did,they,find,any,within,afterward,[END]
then,the,killer,entered,earlier,and,hid,under,the,bed,tyrion,suggested,or,he,climbed,down,from,the,roof,on,a,rope,[END]
perhaps,the,guards,are,lying,[END]
who,s,to,say,they,did,not,do,the,thing,themselves,[END]
doubtless,you,are,right,my,lord,[END]
his,smug,tone,said,otherwise,[END]
but,you,do,not,think,so,[END]
how,was,it,done,then,[END]
for,a,long,moment,varys,said,nothing,[END]
the,only,sound,was,the,stately,clack,of,horseshoes,on,cobbles,[END]
finally,the,eunuch,cleared,his,throat,[END]
my,lord,do,you,believe,in,the,old,powers,[END]
magic,you,mean,tyrion,said,impatiently,[END]
bloodspells,curses,shapeshifting,those,sorts,of,things,he,snorted,[END]
do,you,mean,to,suggest,that,ser,cortnay,was,magicked,to,his,death,[END]
ser,cortnay,had,challenged,lord,stannis,to,single,combat,on,the,morning,he,died,[END]
i,ask,you,is,this,the,act,of,a,man,lost,to,despair,[END]
then,there,is,the,matter,of,lord,renly,s,mysterious,and,most,fortuitous,murder,even,as,his,battle,lines,were,forming,up,to,sweep,his,brother,from,the,field,the,eunuch,paused,a,moment,[END]
my,lord,you,once,asked,me,how,it,was,that,i,was,cut,[END]
i,recall,said,tyrion,[END]
you,did,not,want,to,talk,of,it,[END]
nor,do,i,but,[END]
this,pause,was,longer,than,the,one,before,and,when,varys,spoke,again,his,voice,was,different,somehow,[END]
i,was,an,orphan,boy,apprenticed,to,a,traveling,folly,[END]
our,master,owned,a,fat,little,cog,and,we,sailed,up,and,down,the,narrow,sea,performing,in,all,the,free,cities,and,from,time,to,time,in,oldtown,and,king,s,landing,[END]
one,day,at,myr,a,certain,man,came,to,our,folly,[END]
after,the,performance,he,made,an,offer,for,me,that,my,master,found,too,tempting,to,refuse,[END]
i,was,in,terror,[END]
i,feared,the,man,meant,to,use,me,as,i,had,heard,men,used,small,boys,but,in,truth,the,only,part,of,me,he,had,need,of,was,my,manhood,[END]
he,gave,me,a,potion,that,made,me,powerless,to,move,or,speak,yet,did,nothing,to,dull,my,senses,[END]
with,a,long,hooked,blade,he,sliced,me,root,and,stem,chanting,all,the,while,[END]
i,watched,him,burn,my,manly,parts,on,a,brazier,[END]
the,flames,turned,blue,and,i,heard,a,voice,answer,his,call,though,i,did,not,understand,the,words,they,spoke,[END]
the,mummers,had,sailed,by,the,time,he,was,done,with,me,[END]
once,i,had,served,his,purpose,the,man,had,no,further,interest,in,me,so,he,put,me,out,[END]
when,i,asked,him,what,i,should,do,now,he,answered,that,he,supposed,i,should,die,[END]
to,spite,him,i,resolved,to,live,[END]
i,begged,i,stole,and,i,sold,what,parts,of,my,body,still,remained,to,me,[END]
soon,i,was,as,good,a,thief,as,any,in,myr,and,when,i,was,older,i,learned,that,often,the,contents,of,a,man,s,letters,are,more,valuable,than,the,contents,of,his,purse,[END]
yet,i,still,dream,of,that,night,my,lord,[END]
not,of,the,sorcerer,nor,his,blade,nor,even,the,way,my,manhood,shriveled,as,it,burned,[END]
i,dream,of,the,voice,[END]
the,voice,from,the,flames,[END]
was,it,a,god,a,demon,some,conjurer,s,trick,[END]
i,could,not,tell,you,and,i,know,all,the,tricks,[END]
all,i,can,say,for,a,certainty,is,that,he,called,it,and,it,answered,and,since,that,day,i,have,hated,magic,and,all,those,who,practice,it,[END]
if,lord,stannis,is,one,such,i,mean,to,see,him,dead,[END]
when,he,was,done,they,rode,in,silence,for,a,time,[END]
finally,tyrion,said,a,harrowing,tale,[END]
i,m,sorry,[END]
the,eunuch,sighed,[END]
you,are,sorry,but,you,do,not,believe,me,[END]
no,my,lord,no,need,to,apologize,[END]
i,was,drugged,and,in,pain,and,it,was,a,very,long,time,ago,and,far,across,the,sea,[END]
no,doubt,i,dreamed,that,voice,[END]
i,ve,told,myself,as,much,a,thousand,times,[END]
i,believe,in,steel,swords,gold,coins,and,men,s,wits,said,tyrion,[END]
and,i,believe,there,once,were,dragons,[END]
i,ve,seen,their,skulls,after,all,[END]
let,us,hope,that,is,the,worst,thing,you,ever,see,my,lord,[END]
on,that,we,agree,tyrion,smiled,[END]
and,for,ser,cortnay,s,death,well,we,know,stannis,hired,sellsails,from,the,free,cities,[END]
perhaps,he,bought,himself,a,skilled,assassin,as,well,[END]
a,very,skilled,assassin,[END]
there,are,such,[END]
i,used,to,dream,that,one,day,i,d,be,rich,enough,to,send,a,faceless,man,after,my,sweet,sister,[END]
regardless,of,how,ser,cortnay,died,said,varys,he,is,dead,the,castle,fallen,[END]
stannis,is,free,to,march,[END]
any,chance,we,might,convince,the,dornishmen,to,descend,on,the,marches,asked,tyrion,[END]
none,[END]
a,pity,[END]
well,the,threat,may,serve,to,keep,the,marcher,lords,close,to,their,castles,at,least,[END]
what,news,of,my,father,[END]
if,lord,tywin,has,won,across,the,red,fork,no,word,has,reached,me,yet,[END]
if,he,does,not,hasten,he,may,be,trapped,between,his,foes,[END]
the,oakheart,leaf,and,the,rowan,tree,have,been,seen,north,of,the,mander,[END]
no,word,from,littlefinger,[END]
perhaps,he,never,reached,bitterbridge,[END]
or,perhaps,he,s,died,there,[END]
lord,tarly,has,seized,renly,s,stores,and,put,a,great,many,to,the,sword,florents,chiefly,[END]
lord,caswell,has,shut,himself,up,in,his,castle,[END]
tyrion,threw,back,his,head,and,laughed,[END]
varys,reined,up,nonplussed,[END]
my,lord,[END]
don,t,you,see,the,jest,lord,varys,tyrion,waved,a,hand,at,the,shuttered,windows,at,all,the,sleeping,city,[END]
storm,s,end,is,fallen,and,stannis,is,coming,with,fire,and,steel,and,the,gods,alone,know,what,dark,powers,and,the,good,folk,don,t,have,jaime,to,protect,them,nor,robert,nor,renly,nor,rhaegar,nor,their,precious,knight,of,flowers,[END]
only,me,the,one,they,hate,he,laughed,again,[END]
the,dwarf,the,evil,counselor,the,twisted,little,monkey,demon,[END]
i,m,all,that,stands,between,them,and,chaos,[END]
catelyn,[END]
tell,father,i,have,gone,to,make,him,proud,her,brother,swung,up,into,his,saddle,every,inch,the,lord,in,his,bright,mail,and,flowing,mud-and-water,cloak,[END]
a,silver,trout,ornamented,the,crest,of,his,greathelm,twin,to,the,one,painted,on,his,shield,[END]
he,was,always,proud,of,you,edmure,[END]
and,he,loves,you,fiercely,[END]
believe,that,[END]
i,mean,to,give,him,better,reason,than,mere,birth,he,wheeled,his,warhorse,about,and,raised,a,hand,[END]
trumpets,sounded,a,drum,began,to,boom,the,drawbridge,descended,in,fits,and,starts,and,ser,edmure,tully,led,his,men,out,from,riverrun,with,lances,raised,and,banners,streaming,[END]
i,have,a,greater,host,than,yours,brother,catelyn,thought,as,she,watched,them,go,[END]
a,host,of,doubts,and,fears,[END]
beside,her,brienne,s,misery,was,almost,palpable,[END]
catelyn,had,ordered,garments,sewn,to,her,measure,handsome,gowns,to,suit,her,birth,and,sex,yet,still,she,preferred,to,dress,in,oddments,of,mail,and,boiled,leather,a,swordbelt,cinched,around,her,waist,[END]
she,would,have,been,happier,riding,to,war,with,edmure,no,doubt,but,even,walls,as,strong,as,riverrun,s,required,swords,to,hold,them,[END]
her,brother,had,taken,every,able-bodied,man,for,the,fords,leaving,ser,desmond,grell,to,command,a,garrison,made,up,of,the,wounded,the,old,and,the,sick,along,with,a,few,squires,and,some,untrained,peasant,boys,still,shy,of,manhood,[END]
this,to,defend,a,castle,crammed,full,of,women,and,children,[END]
when,the,last,of,edmure,s,foot,had,shuffled,under,the,portcullis,brienne,asked,what,shall,we,do,now,my,lady,[END]
our,duty,catelyn,s,face,was,drawn,as,she,started,across,the,yard,[END]
i,have,always,done,my,duty,she,thought,[END]
perhaps,that,was,why,her,lord,father,had,always,cherished,her,best,of,all,his,children,[END]
her,two,older,brothers,had,both,died,in,infancy,so,she,had,been,son,as,well,as,daughter,to,lord,hoster,until,edmure,was,born,[END]
then,her,mother,had,died,and,her,father,had,told,her,that,she,must,be,the,lady,of,riverrun,now,and,she,had,done,that,too,[END]
and,when,lord,hoster,promised,her,to,brandon,stark,she,had,thanked,him,for,making,her,such,a,splendid,match,[END]
i,gave,brandon,my,favor,to,wear,and,never,comforted,petyr,once,after,he,was,wounded,nor,bid,him,farewell,when,father,sent,him,off,[END]
and,when,brandon,was,murdered,and,father,told,me,i,must,wed,his,brother,i,did,so,gladly,though,i,never,saw,ned,s,face,until,our,wedding,day,[END]
i,gave,my,maidenhood,to,this,solemn,stranger,and,sent,him,off,to,his,war,and,his,king,and,the,woman,who,bore,him,his,bastard,because,i,always,did,my,duty,[END]
her,steps,took,her,to,the,sept,a,seven-sided,sandstone,temple,set,amidst,her,mother,s,gardens,and,filled,with,rainbow,light,[END]
it,was,crowded,when,they,entered,catelyn,was,not,alone,in,her,need,for,prayer,[END]
she,knelt,before,the,painted,marble,image,of,the,warrior,and,lit,a,scented,candle,for,edmure,and,another,for,robb,off,beyond,the,hills,[END]
keep,them,safe,and,help,them,to,victory,she,prayed,and,bring,peace,to,the,souls,of,the,slain,and,comfort,to,those,they,leave,behind,[END]
the,septon,entered,with,his,censer,and,crystal,while,she,was,at,her,prayers,so,catelyn,lingered,for,the,celebration,[END]
she,did,not,know,this,septon,an,earnest,young,man,close,to,edmure,s,age,[END]
he,performed,his,office,well,enough,and,his,voice,was,rich,and,pleasant,when,he,sang,the,praises,to,the,seven,but,catelyn,found,herself,yearning,for,the,thin,quavering,tones,of,septon,osmynd,long,dead,[END]
osmynd,would,have,listened,patiently,to,the,tale,of,what,she,had,seen,and,felt,in,renly,s,pavilion,and,he,might,have,known,what,it,meant,as,well,and,what,she,must,do,to,lay,to,rest,the,shadows,that,stalked,her,dreams,[END]
osmynd,my,father,uncle,brynden,old,maester,kym,they,always,seemed,to,know,everything,but,now,there,is,only,me,and,it,seems,i,know,nothing,not,even,my,duty,[END]
how,can,i,do,my,duty,if,i,do,not,know,where,it,lies,[END]
catelyn,s,knees,were,stiff,by,the,time,she,rose,though,she,felt,no,wiser,[END]
perhaps,she,would,go,to,the,godswood,tonight,and,pray,to,ned,s,gods,as,well,[END]
they,were,older,than,the,seven,[END]
outside,she,found,song,of,a,very,different,sort,[END]
rymund,the,rhymer,sat,by,the,brewhouse,amidst,a,circle,of,listeners,his,deep,voice,ringing,as,he,sang,of,lord,deremond,at,the,bloody,meadow,[END]
and,there,he,stood,with,sword,in,hand,[END]
the,last,of,darry,s,ten,[END]
brienne,paused,to,listen,for,a,moment,broad,shoulders,hunched,and,thick,arms,crossed,against,her,chest,[END]
a,mob,of,ragged,boys,raced,by,screeching,and,flailing,at,each,other,with,sticks,[END]
why,do,boys,so,love,to,play,at,war,[END]
catelyn,wondered,if,rymund,was,the,answer,[END]
the,singer,s,voice,swelled,as,he,neared,the,end,of,his,song,[END]
and,red,the,grass,beneath,his,feet,[END]
and,red,his,banners,bright,[END]
and,red,the,glow,of,setting,sun,[END]
that,bathed,him,in,its,light,[END]
come,on,come,on,the,great,lord,called,[END]
my,sword,is,hungry,still,[END]
and,with,a,cry,of,savage,rage,[END]
they,swarmed,across,the,rill,[END]
fighting,is,better,than,this,waiting,brienne,said,[END]
you,don,t,feel,so,helpless,when,you,fight,[END]
you,have,a,sword,and,a,horse,sometimes,an,axe,[END]
when,you,re,armored,it,s,hard,for,anyone,to,hurt,you,[END]
knights,die,in,battle,catelyn,reminded,her,[END]
brienne,looked,at,her,with,those,blue,and,beautiful,eyes,[END]
as,ladies,die,in,childbed,[END]
no,one,sings,songs,about,them,[END]
children,are,a,battle,of,a,different,sort,catelyn,started,across,the,yard,[END]
a,battle,without,banners,or,warhorns,but,no,less,fierce,[END]
carrying,a,child,bringing,it,into,the,world,[END]
your,mother,will,have,told,you,of,the,pain,[END]
i,never,knew,my,mother,brienne,said,[END]
my,father,had,ladies,[END]
a,different,lady,every,year,but,[END]
those,were,no,ladies,catelyn,said,[END]
as,hard,as,birth,can,be,brienne,what,comes,after,is,even,harder,[END]
at,times,i,feel,as,though,i,am,being,torn,apart,[END]
would,that,there,were,five,of,me,one,for,each,child,so,i,might,keep,them,all,safe,[END]
and,who,would,keep,you,safe,my,lady,[END]
her,smile,was,wan,and,tired,[END]
why,the,men,of,my,house,[END]
or,so,my,lady,mother,taught,me,[END]
my,lord,father,my,brother,my,uncle,my,husband,they,will,keep,me,safe,[END]
but,while,they,are,away,from,me,i,suppose,you,must,fill,their,place,brienne,[END]
brienne,bowed,her,head,[END]
i,shall,try,my,lady,[END]
later,that,day,maester,vyman,brought,a,letter,[END]
she,saw,him,at,once,hoping,for,some,word,from,robb,or,from,ser,rodrik,in,winterfell,but,the,message,proved,to,be,from,one,lord,meadows,who,named,himself,castellan,of,storm,s,end,[END]
it,was,addressed,to,her,father,her,brother,her,son,or,whoever,now,holds,riverrun,ser,cortnay,penrose,was,dead,the,man,wrote,and,storm,s,end,had,opened,its,gate,to,stannis,baratheon,the,trueborn,and,rightful,heir,[END]
the,castle,garrison,had,sworn,their,swords,to,his,cause,one,and,all,and,no,man,of,them,had,suffered,harm,[END]
save,cortnay,penrose,catelyn,murmured,[END]
she,had,never,met,the,man,yet,she,grieved,to,hear,of,his,passing,[END]
robb,should,know,of,this,at,once,she,said,[END]
do,we,know,where,he,is,[END]
at,last,word,he,was,marching,toward,the,crag,the,seat,of,house,westerling,said,maester,vyman,[END]
if,i,dispatched,a,raven,to,ashemark,it,may,be,that,they,could,send,a,rider,after,him,[END]
do,so,[END]
catelyn,read,the,letter,again,after,the,maester,was,gone,[END]
lord,meadows,says,nothing,of,robert,s,bastard,she,confided,to,brienne,[END]
i,suppose,he,yielded,the,boy,with,the,rest,though,i,confess,i,do,not,understand,why,stannis,wanted,him,so,badly,[END]
perhaps,he,fears,the,boy,s,claim,[END]
a,bastard,s,claim,[END]
no,it,s,something,else,[END]
what,does,this,child,look,like,[END]
he,is,seven,or,eight,comely,with,black,hair,and,bright,blue,eyes,[END]
visitors,oft,thought,him,lord,renly,s,own,son,[END]
and,renly,favored,robert,catelyn,had,a,glimmer,of,understanding,[END]
stannis,means,to,parade,his,brother,s,bastard,before,the,realm,so,men,might,see,robert,in,his,face,and,wonder,why,there,is,no,such,likeness,in,joffrey,[END]
would,that,mean,so,much,[END]
those,who,favor,stannis,will,call,it,proof,[END]
those,who,support,joffrey,will,say,it,means,nothing,her,own,children,had,more,tully,about,them,than,stark,[END]
arya,was,the,only,one,to,show,much,of,ned,in,her,features,[END]
and,jon,snow,but,he,was,never,mine,[END]
she,found,herself,thinking,of,jon,s,mother,that,shadowy,secret,love,her,husband,would,never,speak,of,[END]
does,she,grieve,for,ned,as,i,do,[END]
or,did,she,hate,him,for,leaving,her,bed,for,mine,[END]

they,were,uncomfortable,thoughts,and,futile,[END]
if,jon,had,been,born,of,ashara,dayne,of,starfall,as,some,whispered,the,lady,was,long,dead,if,not,catelyn,had,no,clue,who,or,where,his,mother,might,be,[END]
and,it,made,no,matter,[END]
ned,was,gone,now,and,his,loves,and,his,secrets,had,all,died,with,him,[END]

he,remembered,their,godswood,the,tall,sentinels,armored,in,their,grey-green,needles,the,great,oaks,the,hawthorn,and,ash,and,soldier,pines,and,at,the,center,the,heart,tree,standing,like,some,pale,giant,frozen,in,time,[END]
he,could,almost,smell,the,place,earthy,and,brooding,the,smell,of,centuries,and,he,remembered,how,dark,the,wood,had,been,even,by,day,[END]
that,wood,was,winterfell,[END]
it,was,the,north,[END]
i,never,felt,so,out,of,place,as,i,did,when,i,walked,there,so,much,an,unwelcome,intruder,[END]
he,wondered,if,the,greyjoys,would,feel,it,too,[END]
the,castle,might,well,be,theirs,but,never,that,godswood,[END]
not,in,a,year,or,ten,or,fifty,[END]
tyrion,lannister,walked,his,horse,slowly,toward,the,mud,gate,[END]
winterfell,is,nothing,to,you,he,reminded,himself,[END]
be,glad,the,place,has,fallen,and,look,to,your,own,walls,[END]
the,gate,was,open,[END]
inside,three,great,trebuchets,stood,side,by,side,in,the,market,square,peering,over,the,battlements,like,three,huge,birds,[END]
their,throwing,arms,were,made,from,the,trunks,of,old,oaks,and,banded,with,iron,to,keep,them,from,splitting,[END]
the,gold,cloaks,had,named,them,the,three,whores,because,they,d,be,giving,lord,stannis,such,a,lusty,welcome,[END]
or,so,we,hope,[END]
tyrion,put,his,heels,into,his,horse,and,trotted,through,the,mud,gate,breasting,the,human,tide,[END]
once,beyond,the,whores,the,press,grew,thinner,and,the,street,opened,up,around,him,[END]
the,ride,back,to,the,red,keep,was,uneventful,but,at,the,tower,of,the,hand,he,found,a,dozen,angry,trader,captains,waiting,in,his,audience,chamber,to,protest,the,seizure,of,their,ships,[END]
he,gave,them,a,sincere,apology,and,promised,compensation,once,the,war,was,done,[END]
that,did,little,to,appease,them,[END]
what,if,you,should,lose,my,lord,one,braavosi,asked,[END]
then,apply,to,king,stannis,for,your,compensation,[END]
by,the,time,he,rid,himself,of,them,bells,were,ringing,and,tyrion,knew,he,would,be,late,for,the,installation,[END]
he,waddled,across,the,yard,almost,at,a,run,and,crowded,into,the,back,of,the,castle,sept,as,joffrey,fastened,white,silk,cloaks,about,the,shoulders,of,the,two,newest,members,of,his,kingsguard,[END]
the,rite,seemed,to,require,that,everyone,stand,so,tyrion,saw,nothing,but,a,wall,of,courtly,arses,[END]
on,the,other,hand,once,the,new,high,septon,was,finished,leading,the,two,knights,through,their,solemn,vows,and,anointing,them,in,the,names,of,the,seven,he,would,be,well,positioned,to,be,first,out,the,doors,[END]
he,approved,of,his,sister,s,choice,of,ser,balon,swann,to,take,the,place,of,the,slain,preston,greenfield,[END]
the,swanns,were,marcher,lords,proud,powerful,and,cautious,[END]
pleading,illness,lord,gulian,swann,had,remained,in,his,castle,taking,no,part,in,the,war,but,his,eldest,son,had,ridden,with,renly,and,now,stannis,while,balon,the,younger,served,at,king,s,landing,[END]
if,he,d,had,a,third,son,tyrion,suspected,he,d,be,off,with,robb,stark,[END]
it,was,not,perhaps,the,most,honorable,course,but,it,showed,good,sense,whoever,won,the,iron,throne,the,swanns,intended,to,survive,[END]
in,addition,to,being,well,born,young,ser,balon,was,valiant,courtly,and,skilled,at,arms,good,with,a,lance,better,with,a,morningstar,superb,with,the,bow,[END]
he,would,serve,with,honor,and,courage,[END]
alas,tyrion,could,not,say,the,same,for,cersei,s,second,choice,[END]
ser,osmund,kettleblack,looked,formidable,enough,[END]
he,stood,six,feet,and,six,inches,most,of,it,sinew,and,muscle,and,his,hook,nose,bushy,eyebrows,and,spade-shaped,brown,beard,gave,his,face,a,fierce,aspect,so,long,as,he,did,not,smile,[END]
lowborn,no,more,than,a,hedge,knight,kettleblack,was,utterly,dependent,on,cersei,for,his,advancement,which,was,doubtless,why,she,d,picked,him,[END]
ser,osmund,is,as,loyal,as,he,is,brave,she,d,told,joffrey,when,she,put,forward,his,name,[END]
it,was,true,unfortunately,[END]
the,good,ser,osmund,had,been,selling,her,secrets,to,bronn,since,the,day,she,d,hired,him,but,tyrion,could,scarcely,tell,her,that,[END]
he,supposed,he,ought,not,complain,[END]
the,appointment,gave,him,another,ear,close,to,the,king,unbeknownst,to,his,sister,[END]
and,even,if,ser,osmund,proved,an,utter,craven,he,would,be,no,worse,than,ser,boros,blount,currently,residing,in,a,dungeon,at,rosby,[END]
ser,boros,had,been,escorting,tommen,and,lord,gyles,when,ser,jacelyn,bywater,and,his,gold,cloaks,had,surprised,them,and,had,yielded,up,his,charge,with,an,alacrity,that,would,have,enraged,old,ser,barristan,selmy,as,much,as,it,did,cersei,a,knight,of,the,kingsguard,was,supposed,to,die,in,defense,of,the,king,and,royal,family,[END]
his,sister,had,insisted,that,joffrey,strip,blount,of,his,white,cloak,on,the,grounds,of,treason,and,cowardice,[END]
and,now,she,replaces,him,with,another,man,just,as,hollow,[END]
the,praying,vowing,and,anointing,seemed,to,take,most,of,the,morning,[END]
tyrion,s,legs,soon,began,to,ache,[END]
he,shifted,his,weight,from,one,foot,to,the,other,restless,[END]
lady,tanda,stood,several,rows,up,he,saw,but,her,daughter,was,not,with,her,[END]
he,had,been,half,hoping,to,catch,a,glimpse,of,shae,[END]
varys,said,she,was,doing,well,but,he,would,prefer,to,see,for,himself,[END]
better,a,lady,s,maid,than,a,pot,girl,shae,had,said,when,tyrion,told,her,the,eunuch,s,scheme,[END]
can,i,take,my,belt,of,silver,flowers,and,my,gold,collar,with,the,black,diamonds,you,said,looked,like,my,eyes,[END]
i,won,t,wear,them,if,you,say,i,shouldn,t,[END]
loath,as,he,was,to,disappoint,her,tyrion,had,to,point,out,that,while,lady,tanda,was,by,no,means,a,clever,woman,even,she,might,wonder,if,her,daughter,s,bedmaid,seemed,to,own,more,jewelry,than,her,daughter,[END]
choose,two,or,three,dresses,no,more,he,commanded,her,[END]
good,wool,no,silk,no,samite,and,no,fur,[END]
the,rest,i,ll,keep,in,my,own,chambers,for,when,you,visit,me,it,was,not,the,answer,shae,had,wanted,but,at,least,she,was,safe,[END]
when,the,investiture,was,finally,done,joffrey,marched,out,between,ser,balon,and,ser,osmund,in,their,new,white,cloaks,while,tyrion,lingered,for,a,word,with,the,new,high,septon,who,was,his,choice,and,wise,enough,to,know,who,put,the,honey,on,his,bread,[END]
i,want,the,gods,on,our,side,tyrion,told,him,bluntly,[END]
tell,them,that,stannis,has,vowed,to,burn,the,great,sept,of,baelor,[END]
is,it,true,my,lord,asked,the,high,septon,a,small,shrewd,man,with,a,wispy,white,beard,and,wizened,face,[END]
tyrion,shrugged,[END]
it,may,be,[END]
stannis,burned,the,godswood,at,storm,s,end,as,an,offering,to,the,lord,of,light,[END]
if,he,d,offend,the,old,gods,why,should,he,spare,the,new,[END]
tell,them,that,[END]
tell,them,that,any,man,who,thinks,to,give,aid,to,the,usurper,betrays,the,gods,as,well,as,his,rightful,king,[END]
i,shall,my,lord,[END]
and,i,shall,command,them,to,pray,for,the,health,of,the,king,and,his,hand,as,well,[END]
hallyne,the,pyromancer,was,waiting,on,him,when,tyrion,returned,to,his,solar,and,maester,frenken,had,brought,messages,[END]
he,let,the,alchemist,wait,a,little,longer,while,he,read,what,the,ravens,had,brought,him,[END]
there,was,an,old,letter,from,doran,martell,warning,him,that,storm,s,end,had,fallen,and,a,much,more,intriguing,one,from,balon,greyjoy,on,pyke,who,styled,himself,king,of,the,isles,and,the,north,[END]
he,invited,king,joffrey,to,send,an,envoy,to,the,iron,islands,to,fix,the,borders,between,their,realms,and,discuss,a,possible,alliance,[END]
tyrion,read,the,letter,three,times,and,set,it,aside,[END]
lord,balon,s,longships,would,have,been,a,great,help,against,the,fleet,sailing,up,from,storm,s,end,but,they,were,thousands,of,leagues,away,on,the,wrong,side,of,westeros,and,tyrion,was,far,from,certain,that,he,wanted,to,give,away,half,the,realm,[END]
perhaps,i,should,spill,this,one,in,cersei,s,lap,or,take,it,to,the,council,[END]
only,then,did,he,admit,hallyne,with,the,latest,tallies,from,the,alchemists,[END]
this,cannot,be,true,said,tyrion,as,he,pored,over,the,ledgers,[END]
almost,thirteen,thousand,jars,[END]
do,you,take,me,for,a,fool,[END]
i,m,not,about,to,pay,the,king,s,gold,for,empty,jars,and,pots,of,sewage,sealed,with,wax,i,warn,you,[END]
no,no,hallyne,squeaked,the,sums,are,accurate,i,swear,[END]
we,have,been,hmmm,most,fortunate,my,lord,hand,[END]
another,cache,of,lord,rossart,s,was,found,more,than,three,hundred,jars,[END]
under,the,dragonpit,[END]
some,whores,have,been,using,the,ruins,to,entertain,their,patrons,and,one,of,them,fell,through,a,patch,of,rotted,floor,into,a,cellar,[END]
when,he,felt,the,jars,he,mistook,them,for,wine,[END]
he,was,so,drunk,he,broke,the,seal,and,drank,some,[END]
there,was,a,prince,who,tried,that,once,said,tyrion,dryly,[END]
i,haven,t,seen,any,dragons,rising,over,the,city,so,it,would,seem,it,didn,t,work,this,time,either,the,dragonpit,atop,the,hill,of,rhaenys,had,been,abandoned,for,a,century,and,a,half,[END]
he,supposed,it,was,as,good,a,place,as,any,to,store,wildfire,and,better,than,most,but,it,would,have,been,nice,if,the,late,lord,rossart,had,told,someone,[END]
three,hundred,jars,you,say,[END]
that,still,does,not,account,for,these,totals,[END]
you,are,several,thousand,jars,ahead,of,the,best,estimate,you,gave,me,when,last,we,met,[END]
yes,yes,that,s,so,hallyne,mopped,at,his,pale,brow,with,the,sleeve,of,his,black-and-scarlet,robe,[END]
we,have,been,working,very,hard,my,lord,hand,hmmm,[END]
that,would,doubtless,explain,why,you,are,making,so,much,more,of,the,substance,than,before,smiling,tyrion,fixed,the,pyromancer,with,his,mismatched,stare,[END]
though,it,does,raise,the,question,of,why,you,did,not,begin,working,hard,until,now,[END]
hallyne,had,the,complexion,of,a,mushroom,so,it,was,hard,to,see,how,he,could,turn,any,paler,yet,somehow,he,managed,[END]
we,were,my,lord,hand,my,brothers,and,i,have,been,laboring,day,and,night,from,the,first,i,assure,you,[END]
it,is,only,hmmm,we,have,made,so,much,of,the,substance,that,we,have,become,hmmm,more,practiced,as,it,were,and,also,the,alchemist,shifted,uncomfortably,certain,spells,hmmm,ancient,secrets,of,our,order,very,delicate,very,troublesome,but,necessary,if,the,substance,is,to,be,hmmm,all,it,should,be,[END]
tyrion,was,growing,impatient,[END]
ser,jacelyn,bywater,was,likely,here,by,now,and,ironhand,misliked,waiting,[END]
yes,you,have,secret,spells,how,splendid,[END]
what,of,them,[END]
they,hmmm,seem,to,be,working,better,than,they,were,hallyne,smiled,weakly,[END]
you,don,t,suppose,there,are,any,dragons,about,do,you,[END]
not,unless,you,found,one,under,the,dragonpit,[END]
why,[END]
oh,pardon,i,was,just,remembering,something,old,wisdom,pollitor,told,me,once,when,i,was,an,acolyte,[END]
i,d,asked,him,why,so,many,of,our,spells,seemed,well,not,as,effectual,as,the,scrolls,would,have,us,believe,and,he,said,it,was,because,magic,had,begun,to,go,out,of,the,world,the,day,the,last,dragon,died,[END]
sorry,to,disappoint,you,but,i,ve,seen,no,dragons,[END]
i,have,noticed,the,king,s,justice,lurking,about,however,[END]
should,any,of,these,fruits,you,re,selling,me,turn,out,to,be,filled,with,anything,but,wildfire,you,ll,be,seeing,him,as,well,[END]
hallyne,fled,so,quickly,that,he,almost,bowled,over,ser,jacelyn,no,lord,jacelyn,he,must,remember,that,[END]
ironhand,was,mercifully,direct,as,ever,[END]
he,d,returned,from,rosby,to,deliver,a,fresh,levy,of,spearmen,recruited,from,lord,gyles,s,estates,and,resume,his,command,of,the,city,watch,[END]
how,does,my,nephew,fare,tyrion,asked,when,they,were,done,discussing,the,city,s,defenses,[END]
prince,tommen,is,hale,and,happy,my,lord,[END]
he,has,adopted,a,fawn,some,of,my,men,brought,home,from,a,hunt,[END]
he,had,one,once,before,he,says,but,joffrey,skinned,her,for,a,jerkin,[END]
he,asks,about,his,mother,sometimes,and,often,begins,letters,to,the,princess,myrcella,though,he,never,seems,to,finish,any,[END]
his,brother,however,he,does,not,seem,to,miss,at,all,[END]
you,have,made,suitable,arrangements,for,him,should,the,battle,be,lost,[END]
my,men,have,their,instructions,[END]
which,are,[END]
you,commanded,me,to,tell,no,one,my,lord,[END]
that,made,him,smile,[END]
i,m,pleased,you,remember,should,king,s,landing,fall,he,might,well,be,taken,alive,[END]
better,if,he,did,not,know,where,joffrey,s,heir,might,be,found,[END]
varys,appeared,not,long,after,lord,jacelyn,had,left,[END]
men,are,such,faithless,creatures,he,said,by,way,of,greeting,[END]
tyrion,sighed,[END]
who,s,the,traitor,today,[END]
the,eunuch,handed,him,a,scroll,[END]
so,much,villainy,it,sings,a,sad,song,for,our,age,[END]
did,honor,die,with,our,fathers,[END]
my,father,is,not,dead,yet,tyrion,scanned,the,list,[END]
i,know,some,of,these,names,[END]
these,are,rich,men,[END]
traders,merchants,craftsmen,[END]
why,should,they,conspire,against,us,[END]
it,seems,they,believe,that,lord,stannis,must,win,and,wish,to,share,his,victory,[END]
they,call,themselves,the,antler,men,after,the,crowned,stag,[END]
someone,should,tell,them,that,stannis,changed,his,sigil,[END]
then,they,can,be,the,hot,hearts,it,was,no,matter,for,jests,though,it,appeared,that,these,antler,men,had,armed,several,hundred,followers,to,seize,the,old,gate,once,battle,was,joined,and,admit,the,enemy,to,the,city,[END]
among,the,names,on,the,list,was,the,master,armorer,salloreon,[END]

it,was,the,black,of,night,[END]
the,bedchamber,was,dark,and,still,[END]
what,is,it,[END]
did,i,hear,something,[END]
someone,[END]
wind,sighed,faintly,against,the,shutters,[END]
somewhere,far,off,he,heard,the,yowl,of,a,cat,in,heat,[END]
nothing,else,[END]
sleep,greyjoy,he,told,himself,[END]
the,castle,is,quiet,and,you,have,guards,posted,[END]
at,your,door,at,the,gates,on,the,armory,[END]

kyra,had,worn,him,out,[END]
until,theon,had,sent,for,her,she,had,lived,all,of,her,eighteen,years,in,the,winter,town,without,ever,setting,foot,inside,the,walls,of,the,castle,[END]
she,came,to,him,wet,and,eager,and,lithe,as,a,weasel,and,there,had,been,a,certain,undeniable,spice,to,fucking,a,common,tavern,wench,in,lord,eddard,stark,s,own,bed,[END]
she,murmured,sleepily,as,theon,slid,out,from,under,her,arm,and,got,to,his,feet,[END]
a,few,embers,still,smoldered,in,the,hearth,[END]

a,half-moon,floated,above,the,bell,tower,and,cast,its,reflection,on,the,roof,of,the,glass,gardens,[END]

all,s,well,greyjoy,[END]
hear,the,quiet,[END]
you,ought,to,be,drunk,with,joy,[END]
you,took,winterfell,with,fewer,than,thirty,men,a,feat,to,sing,of,[END]

her,gasps,and,giggles,would,make,a,welcome,respite,from,this,silence,[END]
he,stopped,[END]
he,had,grown,so,used,to,the,howling,of,the,direwolves,that,he,scarcely,heard,it,anymore,[END]

the,wolves,are,quiet,theon,told,him,[END]
go,see,what,they,re,doing,and,come,straight,back,the,thought,of,the,direwolves,running,loose,gave,him,a,queasy,feeling,[END]

summer,and,grey,wind,had,torn,them,to,pieces,[END]

theon,cursed,himself,[END]
he,should,have,kept,a,guard,on,them,but,he,d,deemed,it,more,important,to,have,men,walking,the,walls,and,protecting,the,gates,than,to,nursemaid,a,couple,of,children,one,a,cripple,[END]
outside,he,heard,sobbing,as,the,castle,folk,were,pulled,from,their,beds,and,driven,into,the,yard,[END]

one,of,the,garrons,whickered,and,pawed,at,the,thin,stony,soil,of,the,hollow,where,they,had,taken,shelter,[END]

we,ll,come,when,we,see,it,fall,[END]
no,better,time,to,start,than,now,said,stonesnake,[END]
they,each,took,a,long,coil,of,rope,[END]
stonesnake,carried,a,bag,of,iron,spikes,as,well,and,a,small,hammer,with,its,head,wrapped,in,thick,felt,[END]
their,garrons,they,left,behind,along,with,their,helms,mail,and,ghost,[END]

i,ll,be,back,for,you,[END]
stonesnake,took,the,lead,[END]
he,was,a,short,wiry,man,near,fifty,and,grey,of,beard,but,stronger,than,he,seemed,and,he,had,the,best,night,eyes,of,anyone,jon,had,ever,known,[END]
he,needed,them,tonight,[END]
by,day,the,mountains,were,blue-grey,brushed,with,frost,but,once,the,sun,vanished,behind,the,jagged,peaks,they,turned,black,[END]
now,the,rising,moon,had,limned,them,in,white,and,silver,[END]
the,black,brothers,moved,through,black,shadows,amidst,black,rocks,working,their,way,up,a,steep,twisting,trail,as,their,breath,frosted,in,the,black,air,[END]
jon,felt,almost,naked,without,his,mail,but,he,did,not,miss,its,weight,[END]
this,was,hard,going,and,slow,[END]
to,hurry,here,was,to,risk,a,broken,ankle,or,worse,[END]
stonesnake,seemed,to,know,where,to,put,his,feet,as,if,by,instinct,but,jon,needed,to,be,more,careful,on,the,broken,uneven,ground,[END]
the,skirling,pass,was,really,a,series,of,passes,a,long,twisting,course,that,went,up,around,a,succession,of,icy,wind-carved,peaks,and,down,through,hidden,valleys,that,seldom,saw,the,sun,[END]
apart,from,his,companions,jon,had,glimpsed,no,living,man,since,they,d,left,the,wood,behind,and,begun,to,make,their,way,upward,[END]
the,frostfangs,were,as,cruel,as,any,place,the,gods,had,made,and,as,inimical,to,men,[END]
the,wind,cut,like,a,knife,up,here,and,shrilled,in,the,night,like,a,mother,mourning,her,slain,children,[END]
what,few,trees,they,saw,were,stunted,grotesque,things,growing,sideways,out,of,cracks,and,fissures,[END]
tumbled,shelves,of,rock,often,overhung,the,trail,fringed,with,hanging,icicles,that,looked,like,long,white,teeth,from,a,distance,[END]
yet,even,so,jon,snow,was,not,sorry,he,had,come,[END]
there,were,wonders,here,as,well,[END]
he,had,seen,sunlight,flashing,on,icy,thin,waterfalls,as,they,plunged,over,the,lips,of,sheer,stone,cliffs,and,a,mountain,meadow,full,of,autumn,wildflowers,blue,coldsnaps,and,bright,scarlet,frostfires,and,stands,of,piper,s,grass,in,russet,and,gold,[END]
he,had,peered,down,ravines,so,deep,and,black,they,seemed,certain,to,end,in,some,hell,and,he,had,ridden,his,garron,over,a,wind-eaten,bridge,of,natural,stone,with,nothing,but,sky,to,either,side,[END]
eagles,nested,in,the,heights,and,came,down,to,hunt,the,valleys,circling,effortlessly,on,great,blue-grey,wings,that,seemed,almost,part,of,the,sky,[END]
once,he,had,watched,a,shadowcat,stalk,a,ram,flowing,down,the,mountainside,like,liquid,smoke,until,it,was,ready,to,pounce,[END]
now,it,is,our,turn,to,pounce,[END]
he,wished,he,could,move,as,sure,and,silent,as,that,shadowcat,and,kill,as,quickly,[END]
longclaw,was,sheathed,across,his,back,but,he,might,not,have,room,to,use,it,[END]
he,carried,dirk,and,dagger,for,closer,work,[END]
they,will,have,weapons,as,well,and,i,am,not,armored,[END]
he,wondered,who,would,prove,the,shadowcat,by,night,s,end,and,who,the,ram,[END]
for,a,long,way,they,stayed,to,the,trail,following,its,twists,and,turns,as,it,snaked,along,the,side,of,the,mountain,upward,ever,upward,[END]
sometimes,the,mountain,folded,back,on,itself,and,they,lost,sight,of,the,fire,but,soon,or,late,it,would,always,reappear,[END]
the,path,stonesnake,chose,would,never,have,served,for,the,horses,[END]
in,places,jon,had,to,put,his,back,to,the,cold,stone,and,shuffle,along,sideways,like,a,crab,inch,by,inch,[END]
even,where,the,track,widened,it,was,treacherous,there,were,cracks,big,enough,to,swallow,a,man,s,leg,rubble,to,stumble,over,hollow,places,where,the,water,pooled,by,day,and,froze,hard,by,night,[END]
one,step,and,then,another,jon,told,himself,[END]
one,step,and,then,another,and,i,will,not,fall,[END]
he,had,not,shaved,since,leaving,the,fist,of,the,first,men,and,the,hair,on,his,lip,was,soon,stiff,with,frost,[END]
two,hours,into,the,climb,the,wind,kicked,up,so,fiercely,that,it,was,all,he,could,do,to,hunch,down,and,cling,to,the,rock,praying,he,would,not,be,blown,off,the,mountain,[END]
one,step,and,then,another,he,resumed,when,the,gale,subsided,[END]
one,step,and,then,another,and,i,will,not,fall,[END]
soon,they,were,high,enough,so,that,looking,down,was,best,not,considered,[END]
there,was,nothing,below,but,yawning,blackness,nothing,above,but,moon,and,stars,[END]
the,mountain,is,your,mother,stonesnake,had,told,him,during,an,easier,climb,a,few,days,past,[END]
cling,to,her,press,your,face,up,against,her,teats,and,she,won,t,drop,you,jon,had,made,a,joke,of,it,saying,how,he,d,always,wondered,who,his,mother,was,but,never,thought,to,find,her,in,the,frostfangs,[END]
it,did,not,seem,nearly,so,amusing,now,[END]
one,step,and,then,another,he,thought,clinging,tight,[END]
the,narrow,track,ended,abruptly,where,a,massive,shoulder,of,black,granite,thrust,out,from,the,side,of,the,mountain,[END]
after,the,bright,moonlight,its,shadow,was,so,black,that,it,felt,like,stepping,into,a,cave,[END]
straight,up,here,the,ranger,said,in,a,quiet,voice,[END]
we,want,to,get,above,them,he,peeled,off,his,gloves,tucked,them,through,his,belt,tied,one,end,of,his,rope,around,his,waist,the,other,end,around,jon,[END]
follow,me,when,the,rope,grows,taut,the,ranger,did,not,wait,for,an,answer,but,started,at,once,moving,upward,with,fingers,and,feet,faster,than,jon,would,have,believed,[END]
the,long,rope,unwound,slowly,[END]
jon,watched,him,closely,making,note,of,how,he,went,and,where,he,found,each,handhold,and,when,the,last,loop,of,hemp,uncoiled,he,took,off,his,own,gloves,and,followed,much,more,slowly,[END]
stonesnake,had,passed,the,rope,around,the,smooth,spike,of,rock,he,was,waiting,on,but,as,soon,as,jon,reached,him,he,shook,it,loose,and,was,off,again,[END]
this,time,there,was,no,convenient,cleft,when,he,reached,the,end,of,their,tether,so,he,took,out,his,felt-headed,hammer,and,drove,a,spike,deep,into,a,crack,in,the,stone,with,a,series,of,gentle,taps,[END]
soft,as,the,sounds,were,they,echoed,off,the,stone,so,loudly,that,jon,winced,with,every,blow,certain,that,the,wildlings,must,hear,them,too,[END]
when,the,spike,was,secure,stonesnake,secured,the,rope,to,it,and,jon,started,after,him,[END]
suck,on,the,mountain,s,teat,he,reminded,himself,[END]

i,can,catch,a,breath,on,that,ledge,there,all,i,need,to,do,is,reach,it,[END]
never,look,down,[END]
once,his,foot,slipped,as,he,put,his,weight,on,it,and,his,heart,stopped,in,his,chest,but,the,gods,were,good,and,he,did,not,fall,[END]
he,could,feel,the,cold,seeping,off,the,rock,into,his,fingers,but,he,dared,not,don,his,gloves,gloves,would,slip,no,matter,how,tight,they,seemed,cloth,and,fur,moving,between,skin,and,stone,and,up,here,that,could,kill,him,[END]
his,burned,hand,was,stiffening,up,on,him,and,soon,it,began,to,ache,[END]
then,he,ripped,open,his,thumbnail,somehow,and,after,that,he,left,smears,of,blood,wherever,he,put,his,hand,[END]
he,hoped,he,still,had,all,his,fingers,by,the,end,of,the,climb,[END]
up,they,went,and,up,and,up,black,shadows,creeping,across,the,moonlit,wall,of,rock,[END]
anyone,down,on,the,floor,of,the,pass,could,have,seen,them,easily,but,the,mountain,hid,them,from,the,view,of,the,wildlings,by,their,fire,[END]
they,were,close,now,though,[END]
jon,could,sense,it,[END]
even,so,he,did,not,think,of,the,foes,who,were,waiting,for,him,all,unknowing,but,of,his,brother,at,winterfell,[END]
bran,used,to,love,to,climb,[END]
i,wish,i,had,a,tenth,part,of,his,courage,[END]
the,wall,was,broken,two-thirds,of,the,way,up,by,a,crooked,fissure,of,icy,stone,[END]
stonesnake,reached,down,a,hand,to,help,him,up,[END]
he,had,donned,his,gloves,again,so,jon,did,the,same,[END]
the,ranger,moved,his,head,to,the,left,and,the,two,of,them,crawled,along,the,shelf,three,hundred,yards,or,more,until,they,could,see,the,dull,orange,glow,beyond,the,lip,of,the,cliff,[END]
the,wildlings,had,built,their,watchfire,in,a,shallow,depression,above,the,narrowest,part,of,the,pass,with,a,sheer,drop,below,and,rock,behind,to,shelter,them,from,the,worst,of,the,wind,[END]
that,same,windbreak,allowed,the,black,brothers,to,crawl,within,a,few,feet,of,them,creeping,along,on,their,bellies,until,they,were,looking,down,on,the,men,they,must,kill,[END]

jon,could,hear,the,sounds,of,their,feeding,echoing,off,the,rocks,[END]
it,gave,him,an,uneasy,feeling,[END]
the,warmth,of,the,fire,made,him,realize,how,bone-tired,he,was,but,he,dared,not,sleep,[END]
he,had,taken,a,captive,and,it,was,on,him,to,guard,her,[END]

some,woman,[END]
most,of,them,are,someone,had,said,that,to,him,once,[END]
he,did,not,remember,who,[END]
she,smiled,again,a,flash,of,white,teeth,[END]
and,she,never,sung,you,the,song,o,the,winter,rose,[END]
i,never,knew,my,mother,[END]

yes,it,is,[END]
everything,below,the,wall,s,south,to,us,[END]
he,had,never,thought,of,it,that,way,[END]
i,suppose,it,s,all,in,where,you,re,standing,[END]
aye,ygritte,agreed,[END]
it,always,is,[END]

it,would,be,hours,before,qhorin,came,up,and,a,story,would,help,keep,him,awake,[END]
i,want,to,hear,this,tale,of,yours,[END]
might,be,you,won,t,like,it,much,[END]
i,ll,hear,it,all,the,same,[END]
brave,black,crow,she,mocked,[END]
well,long,before,he,was,king,over,the,free,folk,bael,was,a,great,raider,[END]
stonesnake,gave,a,snort,[END]
a,murderer,robber,and,raper,is,what,you,mean,[END]
that,s,all,in,where,you,re,standing,too,ygritte,said,[END]
the,stark,in,winterfell,wanted,bael,s,head,but,never,could,take,him,and,the,taste,o,failure,galled,him,[END]
one,day,in,his,bitterness,he,called,bael,a,craven,who,preyed,only,on,the,weak,[END]
when,word,o,that,got,back,bael,vowed,to,teach,the,lord,a,lesson,[END]
so,he,scaled,the,wall,skipped,down,the,kingsroad,and,walked,into,winterfell,one,winter,s,night,with,harp,in,hand,naming,himself,sygerrik,of,skagos,[END]
sygerrik,means,deceiver,in,the,old,tongue,that,the,first,men,spoke,and,the,giants,still,speak,[END]
north,or,south,singers,always,find,a,ready,welcome,so,bael,ate,at,lord,stark,s,own,table,and,played,for,the,lord,in,his,high,seat,until,half,the,night,was,gone,[END]
the,old,songs,he,played,and,new,ones,he,d,made,himself,and,he,played,and,sang,so,well,that,when,he,was,done,the,lord,offered,to,let,him,name,his,own,reward,[END]
all,i,ask,is,a,flower,bael,answered,the,fairest,flower,that,blooms,in,the,gardens,o,winterfell,[END]
now,as,it,happened,the,winter,roses,had,only,then,come,into,bloom,and,no,flower,is,so,rare,nor,precious,[END]
so,the,stark,sent,to,his,glass,gardens,and,commanded,that,the,most,beautiful,o,the,winter,roses,be,plucked,for,the,singer,s,payment,[END]
and,so,it,was,done,[END]
but,when,morning,come,the,singer,had,vanished,[END]
and,so,had,lord,brandon,s,maiden,daughter,[END]
her,bed,they,found,empty,but,for,the,pale,blue,rose,that,bael,had,left,on,the,pillow,where,her,head,had,lain,[END]
jon,had,never,heard,this,tale,before,[END]
which,brandon,was,this,supposed,to,be,[END]
brandon,the,builder,lived,in,the,age,of,heroes,thousands,of,years,before,bael,[END]
there,was,brandon,the,burner,and,his,father,brandon,the,shipwright,but,[END]
this,was,brandon,the,daughterless,ygritte,said,sharply,[END]
would,you,hear,the,tale,or,no,[END]
he,scowled,[END]
go,on,[END]
lord,brandon,had,no,other,children,[END]
at,his,behest,the,black,crows,flew,forth,from,their,castles,in,the,hundreds,but,nowhere,could,they,find,any,sign,o,bael,or,this,maid,[END]
for,most,a,year,they,searched,till,the,lord,lost,heart,and,took,to,his,bed,and,it,seemed,as,though,the,line,o,starks,was,at,its,end,[END]
but,one,night,as,he,lay,waiting,to,die,lord,brandon,heard,a,child,s,cry,[END]
he,followed,the,sound,and,found,his,daughter,back,in,her,bedchamber,asleep,with,a,babe,at,her,breast,[END]
bael,had,brought,her,back,[END]
no,[END]
they,had,been,in,winterfell,all,the,time,hiding,with,the,dead,beneath,the,castle,[END]
the,maid,loved,bael,so,dearly,she,bore,him,a,son,the,song,says,[END]
though,if,truth,be,told,all,the,maids,love,bael,in,them,songs,he,wrote,[END]
be,that,as,it,may,what,s,certain,is,that,bael,left,the,child,in,payment,for,the,rose,he,d,plucked,unasked,and,that,the,boy,grew,to,be,the,next,lord,stark,[END]
so,there,it,is,you,have,bael,s,blood,in,you,same,as,me,[END]
it,never,happened,jon,said,[END]
she,shrugged,[END]
might,be,it,did,might,be,it,didn,t,[END]
it,is,a,good,song,though,[END]
my,mother,used,to,sing,it,to,me,[END]
she,was,a,woman,too,jon,snow,[END]
like,yours,she,rubbed,her,throat,where,his,dirk,had,cut,her,[END]
the,song,ends,when,they,find,the,babe,but,there,is,a,darker,end,to,the,story,[END]
thirty,years,later,when,bael,was,king-beyond-the-wall,and,led,the,free,folk,south,it,was,young,lord,stark,who,met,him,at,the,frozen,ford,[END]
and,killed,him,for,bael,would,not,harm,his,own,son,when,they,met,sword,to,sword,[END]
so,the,son,slew,the,father,instead,said,jon,[END]
aye,she,said,but,the,gods,hate,kinslayers,even,when,they,kill,unknowing,[END]
when,lord,stark,returned,from,the,battle,and,his,mother,saw,bael,s,head,upon,his,spear,she,threw,herself,from,a,tower,in,her,grief,[END]
her,son,did,not,long,outlive,her,[END]
one,o,his,lords,peeled,the,skin,off,him,and,wore,him,for,a,cloak,[END]
your,bael,was,a,liar,he,told,her,certain,now,[END]
no,ygritte,said,but,a,bard,s,truth,is,different,than,yours,or,mine,[END]
anyway,you,asked,for,the,story,so,i,told,it,she,turned,away,from,him,closed,her,eyes,and,seemed,to,sleep,[END]
dawn,and,qhorin,halfhand,arrived,together,[END]
the,black,stones,had,turned,to,grey,and,the,eastern,sky,had,gone,indigo,when,stonesnake,spied,the,rangers,below,wending,their,way,upward,[END]
jon,woke,his,captive,and,held,her,by,the,arm,as,they,descended,to,meet,them,[END]
thankfully,there,was,another,way,off,the,mountain,to,the,north,and,west,along,paths,much,gentler,than,the,one,that,had,brought,them,up,here,[END]
they,were,waiting,in,a,narrow,defile,when,their,brothers,appeared,leading,their,garrons,[END]
ghost,raced,ahead,at,first,scent,of,them,[END]
jon,squatted,to,let,the,direwolf,close,his,jaws,around,his,wrist,tugging,his,hand,back,and,forth,[END]
it,was,a,game,they,played,[END]
but,when,he,glanced,up,he,saw,ygritte,watching,with,eyes,as,wide,and,white,as,hen,s,eggs,[END]
qhorin,halfhand,made,no,comment,when,he,saw,the,prisoner,[END]
there,were,three,stonesnake,told,him,[END]
no,more,than,that,[END]
we,passed,two,ebben,said,or,what,the,cats,had,left,of,them,he,eyed,the,girl,sourly,suspicion,plain,on,his,face,[END]
she,yielded,jon,felt,compelled,to,say,[END]
qhorin,s,face,was,impassive,[END]
do,you,know,who,i,am,[END]
qhorin,halfhand,the,girl,looked,half,a,child,beside,him,but,she,faced,him,boldly,[END]
tell,me,true,[END]
if,i,fell,into,the,hands,of,your,people,and,yielded,myself,what,would,it,win,me,[END]
a,slower,death,than,elsewise,[END]
the,big,ranger,looked,to,jon,[END]
we,have,no,food,to,feed,her,nor,can,we,spare,a,man,to,watch,her,[END]

ebben,drew,his,dagger,[END]
a,steel,kiss,will,keep,her,quiet,[END]
jon,s,throat,was,raw,[END]
he,looked,at,them,all,helplessly,[END]
she,yielded,herself,to,me,[END]
then,you,must,do,what,needs,be,done,qhorin,halfhand,said,[END]
you,are,the,blood,of,winterfell,and,a,man,of,the,night,s,watch,he,looked,at,the,others,[END]
come,brothers,[END]
leave,him,to,it,[END]
it,will,go,easier,for,him,if,we,do,not,watch,and,he,led,them,up,the,steep,twisting,trail,toward,the,pale,pink,glow,of,the,sun,where,it,broke,through,a,mountain,cleft,and,before,very,long,only,jon,and,ghost,remained,with,the,wildling,girl,[END]
he,thought,ygritte,might,try,to,run,but,she,only,stood,there,waiting,looking,at,him,[END]
you,never,killed,a,woman,before,did,you,when,he,shook,his,head,she,said,we,die,the,same,as,men,[END]

i,can,t,[END]
the,smoke,might,be,seen,[END]
that,s,so,she,shrugged,[END]
well,there,s,worse,places,to,end,up,than,the,belly,of,a,shadowcat,[END]
he,pulled,longclaw,over,a,shoulder,[END]
aren,t,you,afraid,[END]
last,night,i,was,she,admitted,[END]

jon,[END]
it,was,dark,in,the,skirling,pass,[END]
the,great,stone,flanks,of,the,mountains,hid,the,sun,for,most,of,the,day,so,they,rode,in,shadow,the,breath,of,man,and,horse,steaming,in,the,cold,air,[END]
icy,fingers,of,water,trickled,down,from,the,snowpack,above,into,small,frozen,pools,that,cracked,and,broke,beneath,the,hooves,of,their,garrons,[END]
sometimes,they,would,see,a,few,weeds,struggling,from,some,crack,in,the,rock,or,a,splotch,of,pale,lichen,but,there,was,no,grass,and,they,were,above,the,trees,now,[END]
the,track,was,as,steep,as,it,was,narrow,wending,its,way,ever,upward,[END]
where,the,pass,was,so,constricted,that,rangers,had,to,go,single,file,squire,dalbridge,would,take,the,lead,scanning,the,heights,as,he,went,his,longbow,ever,close,to,hand,[END]
it,was,said,he,had,the,keenest,eyes,in,the,night,s,watch,[END]
ghost,padded,restlessly,by,jon,s,side,[END]
from,time,to,time,he,would,stop,and,turn,his,ears,pricked,as,if,he,heard,something,behind,them,[END]
jon,did,not,think,the,shadowcats,would,attack,living,men,not,unless,they,were,starving,but,he,loosened,longclaw,in,its,scabbard,even,so,[END]
a,wind-carved,arch,of,grey,stone,marked,the,highest,point,of,the,pass,[END]
here,the,way,broadened,as,it,began,its,long,descent,toward,the,valley,of,the,milkwater,[END]
qhorin,decreed,that,they,would,rest,here,until,the,shadows,began,to,grow,again,[END]
shadows,are,friends,to,men,in,black,he,said,[END]
jon,saw,the,sense,of,that,[END]
it,would,be,pleasant,to,ride,in,the,light,for,a,time,to,let,the,bright,mountain,sun,soak,through,their,cloaks,and,chase,the,chill,from,their,bones,but,they,dared,not,[END]
where,there,were,three,watchers,there,might,be,others,waiting,to,sound,the,alarm,[END]
stonesnake,curled,up,under,his,ragged,fur,cloak,and,was,asleep,almost,at,once,[END]
jon,shared,his,salt,beef,with,ghost,while,ebben,and,squire,dalbridge,fed,the,horses,[END]
qhorin,halfhand,sat,with,his,back,to,a,rock,honing,the,edge,of,his,longsword,with,long,slow,strokes,[END]
jon,watched,the,ranger,for,a,few,moments,then,summoned,his,courage,and,went,to,him,[END]
my,lord,he,said,you,never,asked,me,how,it,went,[END]
with,the,girl,[END]
i,am,no,lord,jon,snow,qhorin,slid,the,stone,smoothly,along,the,steel,with,his,two-fingered,hand,[END]
she,told,me,mance,would,take,me,if,i,ran,with,her,[END]
she,told,you,true,[END]
she,even,claimed,we,were,kin,[END]
she,told,me,a,story,[END]
of,bael,the,bard,and,the,rose,of,winterfell,[END]
so,stonesnake,told,me,[END]
it,happens,i,know,the,song,[END]
mance,would,sing,it,of,old,when,he,came,back,from,a,ranging,[END]
he,had,a,passion,for,wildling,music,[END]
aye,and,for,their,women,as,well,[END]
you,knew,him,[END]
we,all,knew,him,his,voice,was,sad,[END]
they,were,friends,as,well,as,brothers,jon,realized,and,now,they,are,sworn,foes,[END]
why,did,he,desert,[END]
for,a,wench,some,say,[END]
for,a,crown,others,would,have,it,qhorin,tested,the,edge,of,his,sword,with,the,ball,of,his,thumb,[END]
he,liked,women,mance,did,and,he,was,not,a,man,whose,knees,bent,easily,that,s,true,[END]
but,it,was,more,than,that,[END]
he,loved,the,wild,better,than,the,wall,[END]
it,was,in,his,blood,[END]
he,was,wildling,born,taken,as,a,child,when,some,raiders,were,put,to,the,sword,[END]
when,he,left,the,shadow,tower,he,was,only,going,home,again,[END]
was,he,a,good,ranger,[END]
he,was,the,best,of,us,said,the,halfhand,and,the,worst,as,well,[END]
only,fools,like,thoren,smallwood,despise,the,wildlings,[END]
they,are,as,brave,as,we,are,jon,[END]
as,strong,as,quick,as,clever,[END]
but,they,have,no,discipline,[END]
they,name,themselves,the,free,folk,and,each,one,thinks,himself,as,good,as,a,king,and,wiser,than,a,maester,[END]
mance,was,the,same,[END]
he,never,learned,how,to,obey,[END]
no,more,than,me,said,jon,quietly,[END]
qhorin,s,shrewd,grey,eyes,seemed,to,see,right,through,him,[END]
so,you,let,her,go,he,did,not,sound,the,least,surprised,[END]
you,know,[END]
now,[END]
tell,me,why,you,spared,her,[END]
it,was,hard,to,put,into,words,[END]
my,father,never,used,a,headsman,[END]
he,said,he,owed,it,to,men,he,killed,to,look,into,their,eyes,and,hear,their,last,words,[END]
and,when,i,looked,into,ygritte,s,eyes,i,[END]
jon,stared,down,at,his,hands,helplessly,[END]
i,know,she,was,an,enemy,but,there,was,no,evil,in,her,[END]
no,more,than,in,the,other,two,[END]
it,was,their,lives,or,ours,jon,said,[END]
if,they,had,seen,us,if,they,had,sounded,that,horn,[END]
the,wildlings,would,hunt,us,down,and,slay,us,true,enough,[END]
stonesnake,has,the,horn,now,though,and,we,took,ygritte,s,knife,and,axe,[END]
she,s,behind,us,afoot,unarmed,[END]
and,not,like,to,be,a,threat,qhorin,agreed,[END]
if,i,had,needed,her,dead,i,would,have,left,her,with,ebben,or,done,the,thing,myself,[END]
then,why,did,you,command,it,of,me,[END]
i,did,not,command,it,[END]
i,told,you,to,do,what,needed,to,be,done,and,left,you,to,decide,what,that,would,be,qhorin,stood,and,slid,his,longsword,back,into,its,scabbard,[END]
when,i,want,a,mountain,scaled,i,call,on,stonesnake,[END]
should,i,need,to,put,an,arrow,through,the,eye,of,some,foe,across,a,windy,battlefield,i,summon,squire,dalbridge,[END]
ebben,can,make,any,man,give,up,his,secrets,[END]
to,lead,men,you,must,know,them,jon,snow,[END]
i,know,more,of,you,now,than,i,did,this,morning,[END]
and,if,i,had,slain,her,asked,jon,[END]
she,would,be,dead,and,i,would,know,you,better,than,i,had,before,[END]
but,enough,talk,[END]
you,ought,be,sleeping,[END]
we,have,leagues,to,go,and,dangers,to,face,[END]
you,will,need,your,strength,[END]
jon,did,not,think,sleep,would,come,easily,but,he,knew,the,halfhand,was,right,[END]
he,found,a,place,out,of,the,wind,beneath,an,overhang,of,rock,and,took,off,his,cloak,to,use,it,for,a,blanket,[END]
ghost,he,called,[END]
here,[END]
to,me,he,always,slept,better,with,the,great,white,wolf,beside,him,there,was,comfort,in,the,smell,of,him,and,welcome,warmth,in,that,shaggy,pale,fur,[END]
this,time,though,ghost,did,no,more,than,look,at,him,[END]
then,he,turned,away,and,padded,around,the,garrons,and,quick,as,that,he,was,gone,[END]
he,wants,to,hunt,jon,thought,[END]
perhaps,there,were,goats,in,these,mountains,[END]
the,shadowcats,must,live,on,something,[END]
just,don,t,try,and,bring,down,a,cat,he,muttered,[END]
even,for,a,direwolf,that,would,be,dangerous,[END]
he,tugged,his,cloak,over,him,and,stretched,out,beneath,the,rock,[END]
when,he,closed,his,eyes,he,dreamed,of,direwolves,[END]
there,were,five,of,them,when,there,should,have,been,six,and,they,were,scattered,each,apart,from,the,others,[END]
he,felt,a,deep,ache,of,emptiness,a,sense,of,incompleteness,[END]
the,forest,was,vast,and,cold,and,they,were,so,small,so,lost,[END]
his,brothers,were,out,there,somewhere,and,his,sister,but,he,had,lost,their,scent,[END]
he,sat,on,his,haunches,and,lifted,his,head,to,the,darkening,sky,and,his,cry,echoed,through,the,forest,a,long,lonely,mournful,sound,[END]
as,it,died,away,he,pricked,up,his,ears,listening,for,an,answer,but,the,only,sound,was,the,sigh,of,blowing,snow,[END]
jon,[END]
the,call,came,from,behind,him,softer,than,a,whisper,but,strong,too,[END]
can,a,shout,be,silent,[END]
he,turned,his,head,searching,for,his,brother,for,a,glimpse,of,a,lean,grey,shape,moving,beneath,the,trees,but,there,was,nothing,only,[END]
a,weirwood,[END]
it,seemed,to,sprout,from,solid,rock,its,pale,roots,twisting,up,from,a,myriad,of,fissures,and,hairline,cracks,[END]
the,tree,was,slender,compared,to,other,weirwoods,he,had,seen,no,more,than,a,sapling,yet,it,was,growing,as,he,watched,its,limbs,thickening,as,they,reached,for,the,sky,[END]
wary,he,circled,the,smooth,white,trunk,until,he,came,to,the,face,[END]
red,eyes,looked,at,him,[END]
fierce,eyes,they,were,yet,glad,to,see,him,[END]
the,weirwood,had,his,brother,s,face,[END]
had,his,brother,always,had,three,eyes,[END]
not,always,came,the,silent,shout,[END]
not,before,the,crow,[END]
he,sniffed,at,the,bark,smelled,wolf,and,tree,and,boy,but,behind,that,there,were,other,scents,the,rich,brown,smell,of,warm,earth,and,the,hard,grey,smell,of,stone,and,something,else,something,terrible,[END]
death,he,knew,[END]
he,was,smelling,death,[END]
he,cringed,back,his,hair,bristling,and,bared,his,fangs,[END]
don,t,be,afraid,i,like,it,in,the,dark,[END]
no,one,can,see,you,but,you,can,see,them,[END]
but,first,you,have,to,open,your,eyes,[END]
see,[END]
like,this,[END]
and,the,tree,reached,down,and,touched,him,[END]
and,suddenly,he,was,back,in,the,mountains,his,paws,sunk,deep,in,a,drift,of,snow,as,he,stood,upon,the,edge,of,a,great,precipice,[END]
before,him,the,skirling,pass,opened,up,into,airy,emptiness,and,a,long,vee-shaped,valley,lay,spread,beneath,him,like,a,quilt,awash,in,all,the,colors,of,an,autumn,afternoon,[END]
a,vast,blue-white,wall,plugged,one,end,of,the,vale,squeezing,between,the,mountains,as,if,it,had,shouldered,them,aside,and,for,a,moment,he,thought,he,had,dreamed,himself,back,to,castle,black,[END]
then,he,realized,he,was,looking,at,a,river,of,ice,several,thousand,feet,high,[END]
under,that,glittering,cold,cliff,was,a,great,lake,its,deep,cobalt,waters,reflecting,the,snowcapped,peaks,that,ringed,it,[END]
there,were,men,down,in,the,valley,he,saw,now,many,men,thousands,a,huge,host,[END]
some,were,tearing,great,holes,in,the,half-frozen,ground,while,others,trained,for,war,[END]
he,watched,as,a,swarming,mass,of,riders,charged,a,shield,wall,astride,horses,no,larger,than,ants,[END]
the,sound,of,their,mock,battle,was,a,rustling,of,steel,leaves,drifting,faintly,on,the,wind,[END]
their,encampment,had,no,plan,to,it,he,saw,no,ditches,no,sharpened,stakes,no,neat,rows,of,horse,lines,[END]
everywhere,crude,earthen,shelters,and,hide,tents,sprouted,haphazardly,like,a,pox,on,the,face,of,the,earth,[END]
he,spied,untidy,mounds,of,hay,smelled,goats,and,sheep,horses,and,pigs,dogs,in,great,profusion,[END]
tendrils,of,dark,smoke,rose,from,a,thousand,cookfires,[END]
this,is,no,army,no,more,than,it,is,a,town,[END]
this,is,a,whole,people,come,together,[END]
across,the,long,lake,one,of,the,mounds,moved,[END]
he,watched,it,more,closely,and,saw,that,it,was,not,dirt,at,all,but,alive,a,shaggy,lumbering,beast,with,a,snake,for,a,nose,and,tusks,larger,than,those,of,the,greatest,boar,that,had,ever,lived,[END]
and,the,thing,riding,it,was,huge,as,well,and,his,shape,was,wrong,too,thick,in,the,leg,and,hips,to,be,a,man,[END]
then,a,sudden,gust,of,cold,made,his,fur,stand,up,and,the,air,thrilled,to,the,sound,of,wings,[END]
as,he,lifted,his,eyes,to,the,ice-white,mountain,heights,above,a,shadow,plummeted,out,of,the,sky,[END]
a,shrill,scream,split,the,air,[END]
he,glimpsed,blue-grey,pinions,spread,wide,shutting,out,the,sun,[END]
ghost,jon,shouted,sitting,up,[END]
he,could,still,feel,the,talons,the,pain,[END]
ghost,to,me,[END]

a,frozen,river,you,say,[END]
the,milkwater,flows,from,a,great,lake,at,the,foot,of,a,glacier,stonesnake,put,in,[END]
there,was,a,tree,with,my,brother,s,face,[END]
the,wildlings,[END]
there,were,thousands,more,than,i,ever,knew,existed,[END]

his,head,ached,and,the,back,of,his,neck,where,the,talons,had,burned,through,him,[END]
but,that,was,in,the,dream,[END]

jon,was,confused,[END]
it,was,only,a,dream,[END]

tell,me,[END]
it,made,him,feel,half,a,fool,to,talk,of,such,things,to,qhorin,and,the,other,rangers,but,he,did,as,he,was,commanded,[END]
none,of,the,black,brothers,laughed,at,him,however,[END]

why,are,we,plagued,with,so,many,treasons,[END]

moonlight,slanted,between,the,slats,of,the,shutters,laying,pale,silvery,bars,across,her,father,s,face,[END]
she,could,hear,the,soft,whisper,of,his,labored,breathing,the,endless,rush,of,waters,the,faint,chords,of,some,love,song,drifting,up,from,the,yard,so,sad,and,sweet,[END]
i,loved,a,maid,as,red,as,autumn,rymund,sang,with,sunset,in,her,hair,[END]
catelyn,never,noticed,when,the,singing,ended,[END]
hours,had,passed,yet,it,seemed,only,a,heartbeat,before,brienne,was,at,the,door,[END]
my,lady,she,announced,softly,[END]
midnight,has,come,[END]
midnight,has,come,father,she,thought,and,i,must,do,my,duty,[END]
she,let,go,of,his,hand,[END]
the,gaoler,was,a,furtive,little,man,with,broken,veins,in,his,nose,[END]
they,found,him,bent,over,a,tankard,of,ale,and,the,remains,of,a,pigeon,pie,more,than,a,little,drunk,[END]
he,squinted,at,them,suspiciously,[END]
begging,your,forgiveness,m,lady,but,lord,edmure,says,no,one,is,to,see,the,kingslayer,without,a,writing,from,him,with,his,seal,upon,it,[END]

his,eyes,fell,[END]
as,m,lady,says,the,keys,were,chained,to,the,studded,leather,belt,that,girdled,his,waist,[END]
he,muttered,under,his,breath,as,he,sorted,through,them,until,he,found,the,one,that,fit,the,door,to,the,kingslayer,s,cell,[END]
go,back,to,your,ale,and,leave,us,she,commanded,[END]
an,oil,lamp,hung,from,a,hook,on,the,low,ceiling,[END]
catelyn,took,it,down,and,turned,up,the,flame,[END]
brienne,see,that,i,am,not,disturbed,[END]
nodding,brienne,took,up,a,position,just,outside,the,cell,her,hand,resting,on,the,pommel,of,her,sword,[END]
my,lady,will,call,if,she,has,need,of,me,[END]
catelyn,shouldered,aside,the,heavy,wood-and-iron,door,and,stepped,into,foul,darkness,[END]
this,was,the,bowels,of,riverrun,and,smelled,the,part,[END]
old,straw,crackled,underfoot,[END]
the,walls,were,discolored,with,patches,of,nitre,[END]
through,the,stone,she,could,hear,the,faint,rush,of,the,tumblestone,[END]
the,lamplight,revealed,a,pail,overflowing,with,feces,in,one,corner,and,a,huddled,shape,in,another,[END]
the,flagon,of,wine,stood,beside,the,door,untouched,[END]
so,much,for,that,ploy,[END]
i,ought,to,be,thankful,that,the,gaoler,did,not,drink,it,himself,i,suppose,[END]
jaime,raised,his,hands,to,cover,his,face,the,chains,around,his,wrists,clanking,[END]

a,moment,if,you,would,jaime,lannister,had,been,allowed,no,razor,since,the,night,he,was,taken,in,the,whispering,wood,and,a,shaggy,beard,covered,his,face,once,so,like,the,queen,s,[END]
glinting,gold,in,the,lamplight,the,whiskers,made,him,look,like,some,great,yellow,beast,magnificent,even,in,chains,[END]
his,unwashed,hair,fell,to,his,shoulders,in,ropes,and,tangles,the,clothes,were,rotting,on,his,body,his,face,was,pale,and,wasted,[END]

such,sudden,generosity,seemed,somewhat,suspect,[END]
i,can,have,your,head,off,anytime,i,want,[END]
why,would,i,need,to,poison,you,[END]
death,by,poison,can,seem,natural,[END]
harder,to,claim,that,my,head,simply,fell,off,he,squinted,up,from,the,floor,his,cat-green,eyes,slowly,becoming,accustomed,to,the,light,[END]
i,d,invite,you,to,sit,but,your,brother,has,neglected,to,provide,me,a,chair,[END]

my,son,may,be,young,but,if,you,take,him,for,a,fool,you,are,sadly,mistaken,[END]

oh,you,ll,find,mine,modest,enough,[END]
your,turnkey,tells,me,nothing,but,vile,lies,and,he,cannot,even,keep,them,straight,[END]

i,am,strong,enough,to,hear,anything,you,care,to,say,[END]
as,you,will,then,[END]
but,first,if,you,d,be,so,kind,[END]
the,wine,[END]
my,throat,is,raw,[END]
catelyn,hung,the,lamp,from,the,door,and,moved,the,cup,and,flagon,closer,[END]
jaime,sloshed,the,wine,around,his,mouth,before,he,swallowed,[END]
sour,and,vile,he,said,but,it,will,do,he,put,his,back,to,the,wall,drew,his,knees,up,to,his,chest,and,stared,at,her,[END]
your,first,question,lady,catelyn,[END]
not,knowing,how,long,this,game,might,continue,catelyn,wasted,no,time,[END]
are,you,joffrey,s,father,[END]
you,would,never,ask,unless,you,knew,the,answer,[END]
i,want,it,from,your,own,lips,[END]
he,shrugged,[END]
joffrey,is,mine,[END]
as,are,the,rest,of,cersei,s,brood,i,suppose,[END]
you,admit,to,being,your,sister,s,lover,[END]
i,ve,always,loved,my,sister,and,you,owe,me,two,answers,[END]
do,all,my,kin,still,live,[END]
ser,stafford,lannister,was,slain,at,oxcross,i,am,told,[END]
jaime,was,unmoved,[END]
uncle,dolt,my,sister,called,him,[END]
it,s,cersei,and,tyrion,who,concern,me,[END]
as,well,as,my,lord,father,[END]
they,live,all,three,but,not,long,if,the,gods,are,good,[END]
jaime,drank,some,more,wine,[END]
ask,your,next,[END]
catelyn,wondered,if,he,would,dare,answer,her,next,question,with,anything,but,a,lie,[END]
how,did,my,son,bran,come,to,fall,[END]
i,flung,him,from,a,window,[END]
the,easy,way,he,said,it,took,her,voice,away,for,an,instant,[END]
if,i,had,a,knife,i,would,kill,him,now,she,thought,until,she,remembered,the,girls,[END]
her,throat,constricted,as,she,said,you,were,a,knight,sworn,to,defend,the,weak,and,innocent,[END]
he,was,weak,enough,but,perhaps,not,so,innocent,[END]
he,was,spying,on,us,[END]
bran,would,not,spy,[END]
then,blame,those,precious,gods,of,yours,who,brought,the,boy,to,our,window,and,gave,him,a,glimpse,of,something,he,was,never,meant,to,see,[END]
blame,the,gods,she,said,incredulous,[END]
yours,was,the,hand,that,threw,him,[END]
you,meant,for,him,to,die,[END]
his,chains,chinked,softly,[END]
i,seldom,fling,children,from,towers,to,improve,their,health,[END]
yes,i,meant,for,him,to,die,[END]
and,when,he,did,not,you,knew,your,danger,was,worse,than,ever,so,you,gave,your,catspaw,a,bag,of,silver,to,make,certain,bran,would,never,wake,[END]
did,i,now,jaime,lifted,his,cup,and,took,a,long,swallow,[END]
i,won,t,deny,we,talked,of,it,but,you,were,with,the,boy,day,and,night,your,maester,and,lord,eddard,attended,him,frequently,and,there,were,guards,even,those,damned,direwolves,[END]
it,would,have,required,cutting,my,way,through,half,of,winterfell,[END]
and,why,bother,when,the,boy,seemed,like,to,die,of,his,own,accord,[END]
if,you,lie,to,me,this,session,is,at,an,end,catelyn,held,out,her,hands,to,show,him,her,fingers,and,palms,[END]
the,man,who,came,to,slit,bran,s,throat,gave,me,these,scars,[END]
you,swear,you,had,no,part,in,sending,him,[END]
on,my,honor,as,a,lannister,[END]
your,honor,as,a,lannister,is,worth,less,than,this,she,kicked,over,the,waste,pail,[END]
foul-smelling,brown,ooze,crept,across,the,floor,of,the,cell,soaking,into,the,straw,[END]
jaime,lannister,backed,away,from,the,spill,as,far,as,his,chains,would,allow,[END]
i,may,indeed,have,shit,for,honor,i,won,t,deny,it,but,i,have,never,yet,hired,anyone,to,do,my,killing,[END]
believe,what,you,will,lady,stark,but,if,i,had,wanted,your,bran,dead,i,would,have,slain,him,myself,[END]
gods,be,merciful,he,s,telling,the,truth,[END]
if,you,did,not,send,the,killer,your,sister,did,[END]
if,so,i,d,know,[END]
cersei,keeps,no,secrets,from,me,[END]
then,it,was,the,imp,[END]
tyrion,is,as,innocent,as,your,bran,[END]
he,wasn,t,climbing,around,outside,of,anyone,s,window,spying,[END]
then,why,did,the,assassin,have,his,dagger,[END]
what,dagger,was,this,[END]
it,was,so,long,she,said,holding,her,hands,apart,plain,but,finely,made,with,a,blade,of,valyrian,steel,and,a,dragonbone,hilt,[END]
your,brother,won,it,from,lord,baelish,at,the,tourney,on,prince,joffrey,s,name,day,[END]

tyrion,always,backed,me,in,the,lists,jaime,said,but,that,day,ser,loras,unhorsed,me,[END]
a,mischance,i,took,the,boy,too,lightly,but,no,matter,[END]

she,had,refused,to,believe,him,[END]
petyr,had,sworn,otherwise,petyr,who,had,been,almost,a,brother,petyr,who,loved,her,so,much,he,fought,a,duel,for,her,hand,[END]

i,was,the,youngest,man,ever,to,wear,the,white,cloak,[END]
and,the,youngest,to,betray,all,it,stood,for,kingslayer,[END]
kingslayer,he,pronounced,carefully,[END]
and,such,a,king,he,was,he,lifted,his,cup,[END]
to,aerys,targaryen,the,second,of,his,name,lord,of,the,seven,kingdoms,and,protector,of,the,realm,[END]
and,to,the,sword,that,opened,his,throat,[END]
a,golden,sword,don,t,you,know,[END]
until,his,blood,ran,red,down,the,blade,[END]
those,are,the,lannister,colors,red,and,gold,[END]
as,he,laughed,she,realized,the,wine,had,done,its,work,jaime,had,drained,most,of,the,flagon,and,he,was,drunk,[END]
only,a,man,like,you,would,be,proud,of,such,an,act,[END]

brandon,was,different,from,his,brother,wasn,t,he,[END]
he,had,blood,in,his,veins,instead,of,cold,water,[END]
more,like,me,[END]
brandon,was,nothing,like,you,[END]
if,you,say,so,[END]
you,and,he,were,to,wed,[END]
he,was,on,his,way,to,riverrun,when,[END]
strange,how,telling,it,still,made,her,throat,grow,tight,after,all,these,years,[END]
when,he,heard,about,lyanna,and,went,to,king,s,landing,instead,[END]
it,was,a,rash,thing,to,do,she,remembered,how,her,own,father,had,raged,when,the,news,had,been,brought,to,riverrun,[END]
the,gallant,fool,was,what,he,called,brandon,[END]
jaime,poured,the,last,half,cup,of,wine,[END]
he,rode,into,the,red,keep,with,a,few,companions,shouting,for,prince,rhaegar,to,come,out,and,die,[END]
but,rhaegar,wasn,t,there,[END]
aerys,sent,his,guards,to,arrest,them,all,for,plotting,his,son,s,murder,[END]
the,others,were,lords,sons,too,it,seems,to,me,[END]
ethan,glover,was,brandon,s,squire,catelyn,said,[END]
he,was,the,only,one,to,survive,[END]
the,others,were,jeffory,mallister,kyle,royce,and,elbert,arryn,jon,arryn,s,nephew,and,heir,it,was,queer,how,she,still,remembered,the,names,after,so,many,years,[END]
aerys,accused,them,of,treason,and,summoned,their,fathers,to,court,to,answer,the,charge,with,the,sons,as,hostages,[END]
when,they,came,he,had,them,murdered,without,trial,[END]
fathers,and,sons,both,[END]
there,were,trials,[END]
of,a,sort,[END]
lord,rickard,demanded,trial,by,combat,and,the,king,granted,the,request,[END]
stark,armored,himself,as,for,battle,thinking,to,duel,one,of,the,kingsguard,[END]
me,perhaps,[END]
instead,they,took,him,to,the,throne,room,and,suspended,him,from,the,rafters,while,two,of,aerys,s,pyromancers,kindled,a,blaze,beneath,him,[END]
the,king,told,him,that,fire,was,the,champion,of,house,targaryen,[END]
so,all,lord,rickard,needed,to,do,to,prove,himself,innocent,of,treason,was,[END]
well,not,burn,[END]
when,the,fire,was,blazing,brandon,was,brought,in,[END]
his,hands,were,chained,behind,his,back,and,around,his,neck,was,a,wet,leathern,cord,attached,to,a,device,the,king,had,brought,from,tyrosh,[END]
his,legs,were,left,free,though,and,his,longsword,was,set,down,just,beyond,his,reach,[END]
the,pyromancers,roasted,lord,rickard,slowly,banking,and,fanning,that,fire,carefully,to,get,a,nice,even,heat,[END]
his,cloak,caught,first,and,then,his,surcoat,and,soon,he,wore,nothing,but,metal,and,ashes,[END]
next,he,would,start,to,cook,aerys,promised,[END]
unless,his,son,could,free,him,[END]
brandon,tried,but,the,more,he,struggled,the,tighter,the,cord,constricted,around,his,throat,[END]
in,the,end,he,strangled,himself,[END]
as,for,lord,rickard,the,steel,of,his,breastplate,turned,cherry-red,before,the,end,and,his,gold,melted,off,his,spurs,and,dripped,down,into,the,fire,[END]
i,stood,at,the,foot,of,the,iron,throne,in,my,white,armor,and,white,cloak,filling,my,head,with,thoughts,of,cersei,[END]
after,gerold,hightower,himself,took,me,aside,and,said,to,me,you,swore,a,vow,to,guard,the,king,not,to,judge,him,that,was,the,white,bull,loyal,to,the,end,and,a,better,man,than,me,all,agree,[END]
aerys,[END]
catelyn,could,taste,bile,at,the,back,of,her,throat,[END]
the,story,was,so,hideous,she,suspected,it,had,to,be,true,[END]
aerys,was,mad,the,whole,realm,knew,it,but,if,you,would,have,me,believe,you,slew,him,to,avenge,brandon,stark,[END]
i,made,no,such,claim,[END]
the,starks,were,nothing,to,me,[END]
i,will,say,i,think,it,passing,odd,that,i,am,loved,by,one,for,a,kindness,i,never,did,and,reviled,by,so,many,for,my,finest,act,[END]
at,robert,s,coronation,i,was,made,to,kneel,at,the,royal,feet,beside,grand,maester,pycelle,and,varys,the,eunuch,so,that,he,might,forgive,us,our,crimes,before,he,took,us,into,his,service,[END]
as,for,your,ned,he,should,have,kissed,the,hand,that,slew,aerys,but,he,preferred,to,scorn,the,arse,he,found,sitting,on,robert,s,throne,[END]
i,think,ned,stark,loved,robert,better,than,he,ever,loved,his,brother,or,his,father,[END]
or,even,you,my,lady,[END]
he,was,never,unfaithful,to,robert,was,he,jaime,gave,a,drunken,laugh,[END]

a,naked,man,fell,from,the,sky,and,landed,on,the,deck,body,bursting,like,a,melon,dropped,from,a,tower,[END]
his,blood,spattered,through,the,slit,of,tyrion,s,helm,[END]
stones,began,to,plummet,down,crashing,through,the,decks,and,turning,men,to,pulp,until,the,whole,bridge,gave,a,shudder,and,twisted,violently,underfoot,knocking,him,sideways,[END]
suddenly,the,river,was,pouring,into,his,helm,[END]
he,ripped,it,off,and,crawled,along,the,listing,deck,until,the,water,was,only,neck,deep,[END]
a,groaning,filled,the,air,like,the,death,cries,of,some,enormous,beast,[END]
the,ship,he,had,time,to,think,the,ship,s,about,to,tear,loose,[END]
the,broken,galleys,were,ripping,apart,the,bridge,breaking,apart,[END]
no,sooner,had,he,come,to,that,realization,than,he,heard,a,sudden,crack,loud,as,thunder,the,deck,lurched,beneath,him,and,he,slid,back,down,into,the,water,[END]
the,list,was,so,steep,he,had,to,climb,back,up,hauling,himself,along,a,snapped,line,inch,by,bloody,inch,[END]
out,of,the,corner,of,his,eye,he,saw,the,hulk,they,d,been,tangled,with,drifting,downstream,with,the,current,spinning,slowly,as,men,leapt,over,her,side,[END]
some,wore,stannis,s,flaming,heart,some,joffrey,s,stag-and-lion,some,other,badges,but,it,seemed,to,make,no,matter,[END]
fires,were,burning,upstream,and,down,[END]
on,one,side,of,him,was,a,raging,battle,a,great,confusion,of,bright,banners,waving,above,a,sea,of,struggling,men,shield,walls,forming,and,breaking,mounted,knights,cutting,through,the,press,dust,and,mud,and,blood,and,smoke,[END]
on,the,other,side,the,red,keep,loomed,high,on,its,hill,spitting,fire,[END]
they,were,on,the,wrong,sides,though,[END]
for,a,moment,tyrion,thought,he,was,going,mad,that,stannis,and,the,castle,had,traded,places,[END]
how,could,stannis,cross,to,the,north,bank,[END]
belatedly,he,realized,that,the,deck,was,turning,and,somehow,he,had,gotten,spun,about,so,castle,and,battle,had,changed,sides,[END]
battle,what,battle,if,stannis,hasn,t,crossed,who,is,he,fighting,[END]
tyrion,was,too,tired,to,make,sense,of,it,[END]
his,shoulder,ached,horribly,and,when,he,reached,up,to,rub,it,he,saw,the,arrow,and,remembered,[END]
i,have,to,get,off,this,ship,[END]
downstream,was,nothing,but,a,wall,of,fire,and,if,the,wreck,broke,loose,the,current,would,take,him,right,into,it,[END]
someone,was,calling,his,name,faintly,through,the,din,of,battle,[END]
tyrion,tried,to,shout,back,[END]
here,[END]
here,i,m,here,help,me,his,voice,sounded,so,thin,he,could,scarcely,hear,himself,[END]
he,pulled,himself,up,the,slanting,deck,and,grabbed,for,the,rail,[END]
the,hull,slammed,into,the,next,galley,over,and,rebounded,so,violently,he,was,almost,knocked,into,the,water,[END]
where,had,all,his,strength,gone,[END]
it,was,all,he,could,do,to,hang,on,[END]
my,lord,[END]
take,my,hand,[END]
my,lord,tyrion,[END]
there,on,the,deck,of,the,next,ship,across,a,widening,gulf,of,black,water,stood,ser,mandon,moore,a,hand,extended,[END]
yellow,and,green,fire,shone,against,the,white,of,his,armor,and,his,lobstered,gauntlet,was,sticky,with,blood,but,tyrion,reached,for,it,all,the,same,wishing,his,arms,were,longer,[END]
it,was,only,at,the,very,last,as,their,fingers,brushed,across,the,gap,that,something,niggled,at,him,[END]
ser,mandon,was,holding,out,his,left,hand,why,[END]
was,that,why,he,reeled,backward,or,did,he,see,the,sword,after,all,[END]
he,would,never,know,[END]
the,point,slashed,just,beneath,his,eyes,and,he,felt,its,cold,hard,touch,and,then,a,blaze,of,pain,[END]
his,head,spun,around,as,if,he,d,been,slapped,[END]
the,shock,of,the,cold,water,was,a,second,slap,more,jolting,than,the,first,[END]
he,flailed,for,something,to,grab,on,to,knowing,that,once,he,went,down,he,was,not,like,to,come,back,up,[END]
somehow,his,hand,found,the,splintered,end,of,a,broken,oar,[END]
clutching,it,tight,as,a,desperate,lover,he,shinnied,up,foot,by,foot,[END]
his,eyes,were,full,of,water,his,mouth,was,full,of,blood,and,his,head,throbbed,horribly,[END]
gods,give,me,strength,to,reach,the,deck,[END]
there,was,nothing,else,only,the,oar,the,water,the,deck,[END]
finally,he,rolled,over,the,side,and,lay,breathless,and,exhausted,flat,on,his,back,[END]
balls,of,green,and,orange,flame,crackled,overhead,leaving,streaks,between,the,stars,[END]
he,had,a,moment,to,think,how,pretty,it,was,before,ser,mandon,blocked,out,the,view,[END]
the,knight,was,a,white,steel,shadow,his,eyes,shining,darkly,behind,his,helm,[END]
tyrion,had,no,more,strength,than,a,rag,doll,[END]
ser,mandon,put,the,point,of,his,sword,to,the,hollow,of,his,throat,and,curled,both,hands,around,the,hilt,[END]
and,suddenly,he,lurched,to,the,left,staggering,into,the,rail,[END]
wood,split,and,ser,mandon,moore,vanished,with,a,shout,and,a,splash,[END]
an,instant,later,the,hulls,came,slamming,together,again,so,hard,the,deck,seemed,to,jump,[END]
then,someone,was,kneeling,over,him,[END]

you,need,not,go,alone,though,[END]

his,face,had,grown,cold,at,that,[END]
then,go,[END]
but,where,[END]
somewhere,far,from,here,[END]
well,perhaps,it,was,time,[END]
the,people,of,her,khalasar,had,welcomed,the,chance,to,recover,from,the,ravages,of,the,red,waste,but,now,that,they,were,plump,and,rested,once,again,they,began,to,grow,unruly,[END]

they,were,a,warrior,people,not,made,for,cities,[END]
perhaps,she,had,lingered,in,qarth,too,long,seduced,by,its,comforts,and,its,beauties,[END]
it,was,a,city,that,always,promised,more,than,it,would,give,you,it,seemed,to,her,and,her,welcome,here,had,turned,sour,since,the,house,of,the,undying,had,collapsed,in,a,great,gout,of,smoke,and,flame,[END]
overnight,the,qartheen,had,come,to,remember,that,dragons,were,dangerous,[END]
no,longer,did,they,vie,with,each,other,to,give,her,gifts,[END]
instead,the,tourmaline,brotherhood,had,called,openly,for,her,expulsion,and,the,ancient,guild,of,spicers,for,her,death,[END]
it,was,all,xaro,could,do,to,keep,the,thirteen,from,joining,them,[END]
but,where,am,i,to,go,[END]
ser,jorah,proposed,that,they,journey,farther,east,away,from,her,enemies,in,the,seven,kingdoms,[END]
her,bloodriders,would,sooner,have,returned,to,their,great,grass,sea,even,if,it,meant,braving,the,red,waste,again,[END]
dany,herself,had,toyed,with,the,idea,of,settling,in,vaes,tolorro,until,her,dragons,grew,great,and,strong,[END]
but,her,heart,was,full,of,doubts,[END]
each,of,these,felt,wrong,somehow,[END]
and,even,when,she,decided,where,to,go,the,question,of,how,she,would,get,there,remained,troublesome,[END]
xaro,xhoan,daxos,would,be,no,help,to,her,she,knew,that,now,[END]
for,all,his,professions,of,devotion,he,was,playing,his,own,game,not,unlike,pyat,pree,[END]
the,night,he,asked,her,to,leave,dany,had,begged,one,last,favor,of,him,[END]

for,one,of,your,dragons,you,shall,have,ten,of,the,finest,ships,in,my,fleet,[END]
you,need,only,say,that,one,sweet,word,[END]

but,you,have,three,dragons,[END]
grant,me,one,for,all,my,kindnesses,[END]
you,will,still,have,two,and,thirty,ships,as,well,[END]
thirty,ships,would,be,enough,to,land,a,small,army,on,the,shore,of,westeros,[END]

eighty-three,if,one,does,not,count,my,pleasure,barge,[END]

i,am,trying,to,set,a,price,on,one,of,the,three,living,dragons,in,the,world,dany,smiled,at,him,sweetly,[END]
it,seems,to,me,that,one-third,of,all,the,ships,in,the,world,would,be,fair,[END]

her,only,consolation,was,that,at,least,she,d,had,the,great,good,sense,not,to,marry,him,[END]
the,warlocks,whispered,of,three,treasons,[END]
once,for,blood,and,once,for,gold,and,once,for,love,[END]

could,pyat,pree,and,xaro,xhoan,daxos,be,the,second,and,the,third,[END]
she,did,not,think,so,[END]
what,pyat,did,was,not,for,gold,and,xaro,had,never,truly,loved,her,[END]

on,the,breast,was,sewn,his,sigil,the,flayed,man,of,the,dreadfort,[END]
she,tied,her,shoes,threw,a,wool,cloak,over,her,skinny,shoulders,and,knotted,it,under,her,throat,[END]
quiet,as,a,shadow,she,moved,back,down,the,stairs,[END]
outside,the,lord,s,solar,she,paused,to,listen,at,the,door,easing,it,open,slowly,when,she,heard,only,silence,[END]
the,sheepskin,map,was,on,the,table,beside,the,remains,of,lord,bolton,s,supper,[END]

she,hoped,they,would,not,hurt,him,afterward,but,she,knew,they,probably,would,[END]
leading,the,horses,across,the,castle,was,the,worst,part,[END]
she,stayed,in,the,shadow,of,the,curtain,wall,whenever,she,could,so,the,sentries,walking,their,rounds,on,the,ramparts,above,would,have,needed,to,look,almost,straight,down,to,see,her,[END]
and,if,they,do,what,of,it,[END]
i,m,my,lord,s,own,cupbearer,[END]
it,was,a,chill,dank,autumn,night,[END]
clouds,were,blowing,in,from,the,west,hiding,the,stars,and,the,wailing,tower,screamed,mournfully,at,every,gust,of,wind,[END]
it,smells,like,rain,[END]
arya,did,not,know,whether,that,would,be,good,or,bad,for,their,escape,[END]
no,one,saw,her,and,she,saw,no,one,only,a,grey,and,white,cat,creeping,along,atop,the,godswood,wall,[END]

the,tower,of,ghosts,was,the,most,ruinous,of,harrenhal,s,five,immense,towers,[END]
it,stood,dark,and,desolate,behind,the,remains,of,a,collapsed,sept,where,only,rats,had,come,to,pray,for,near,three,hundred,years,[END]

it,seemed,as,though,she,waited,a,long,time,[END]
the,horses,nibbled,at,the,weeds,that,grew,up,between,the,broken,stones,while,the,clouds,swallowed,the,last,of,the,stars,[END]

here,i,am,she,stood,[END]

the,boys,picked,their,way,toward,her,over,tumbled,stones,[END]

hot,pie,s,red,round,face,peered,out,from,under,a,hood,[END]
he,had,a,sack,of,bread,dangling,from,his,right,hand,and,a,big,wheel,of,cheese,under,his,left,arm,[END]
there,s,a,guard,on,that,postern,said,gendry,quietly,[END]

alone,she,slid,through,the,shadow,of,the,tower,of,ghosts,[END]

she,had,not,taken,the,sword,gendry,had,brought,her,not,yet,[END]
for,this,the,dagger,would,be,better,[END]
it,was,good,and,sharp,[END]
this,postern,was,the,least,of,harrenhal,s,gates,a,narrow,door,of,stout,oak,studded,with,iron,nails,set,in,an,angle,of,the,wall,beneath,a,defensive,tower,[END]
only,one,man,was,set,to,guard,it,but,she,knew,there,would,be,sentries,up,in,that,tower,as,well,and,others,nearby,walking,the,walls,[END]
whatever,happened,she,must,be,quiet,as,a,shadow,[END]
he,must,not,call,out,[END]
a,few,scattered,raindrops,had,begun,to,fall,[END]
she,felt,one,land,on,her,brow,and,run,slowly,down,her,nose,[END]
she,made,no,effort,to,hide,but,approached,the,guard,openly,as,if,lord,bolton,himself,had,sent,her,[END]
he,watched,her,come,curious,as,to,what,might,bring,a,page,here,at,this,black,hour,[END]
when,she,got,closer,she,saw,that,he,was,a,northman,very,tall,and,thin,huddled,in,a,ragged,fur,cloak,[END]
that,was,bad,[END]
she,might,have,been,able,to,trick,a,frey,or,one,of,the,brave,companions,but,the,dreadfort,men,had,served,roose,bolton,their,whole,life,and,they,knew,him,better,than,she,did,[END]

he,belonged,to,roose,bolton,[END]
when,she,reached,him,she,pushed,back,her,cloak,so,he,would,see,the,flayed,man,on,her,breast,[END]
lord,bolton,sent,me,[END]
at,this,hour,[END]
why,for,[END]
she,could,see,the,gleam,of,steel,under,the,fur,and,she,did,not,know,if,she,was,strong,enough,to,drive,the,point,of,the,dagger,through,chainmail,[END]
his,throat,it,must,be,his,throat,but,he,s,too,tall,i,ll,never,reach,it,[END]
for,a,moment,she,did,not,know,what,to,say,[END]
for,a,moment,she,was,a,little,girl,again,and,scared,and,the,rain,on,her,face,felt,like,tears,[END]
he,told,me,to,give,all,his,guards,a,silver,piece,for,their,good,service,the,words,seemed,to,come,out,of,nowhere,[END]

he,listened,to,the,blasphemies,and,wondered,if,he,was,dying,[END]
after,a,time,the,room,faded,[END]
he,found,himself,outside,the,city,walking,through,a,world,without,color,[END]

metal,and,cloth,were,thrown,in,the,back,of,a,white,wooden,wagon,pulled,by,two,tall,black,horses,[END]
